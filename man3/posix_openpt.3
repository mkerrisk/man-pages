.SH NAME
posix_openpt \- open a pseudo-terminal device
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "int posix_openpt(int " flags ");"
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR posix_openpt ()
function opens an unused pseudo-terminal master device, returning a
file descriptor that can be used to refer to that device.

The
.I flags
argument is a bit mask that ORs together zero or more of
the following flags:
.TP
.B O_RDWR
Open the device for both reading and writing.
It is usual to specify this flag.
.TP
.B O_NOCTTY
Do not make this device the controlling terminal for the process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.BR posix_openpt ()
returns a nonnegative file descriptor which is the lowest
numbered unused descriptor.
On failure, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR open (2).
.SH VERSIONS
Glibc support for
.BR posix_openpt ()
has been provided since version 2.2.1.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.BR posix_openpt ()
is part of the Unix98 pseudo-terminal support (see
.BR pts (4)).
This function is specified in POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
This function is a recent invention in POSIX.
Some Unix implementations that support System V
(aka Unix 98) pseudo-terminals don't have this function, but it
is easy to implement:
.in +4n
.nf

int
posix_openpt(int flags)
{
    return open("/dev/ptmx", flags);
}
.fi
