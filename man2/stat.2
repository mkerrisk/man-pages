.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These functions return information about a file.
No permissions are required on the file itself, but\(emin the case of
.BR stat ()
and
.BR lstat ()
\(em
execute (search) permission is required on all of the directories in
.I path
that lead to the file.
.PP
.BR stat ()
stats the file pointed to by
.I path
and fills in
.IR buf .

.BR lstat ()
is identical to
.BR stat (),
except that if
.I path
is a symbolic link, then the link itself is stat-ed,
not the file that it refers to.

.BR fstat ()
is identical to
.BR stat (),
except that the file to be stat-ed is specified by the file descriptor
.IR fd .
.PP
All of these system calls return a
.I stat
structure, which contains the following fields:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
struct stat {
    dev_t     st_dev;         /* ID of device containing file */
    ino_t     st_ino;         /* inode number */
    mode_t    st_mode;        /* protection */
    nlink_t   st_nlink;       /* number of hard links */
    uid_t     st_uid;         /* user ID of owner */
    gid_t     st_gid;         /* group ID of owner */
    dev_t     st_rdev;        /* device ID (if special file) */
    off_t     st_size;        /* total size, in bytes */
    blksize_t st_blksize;     /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
    blkcnt_t  st_blocks;      /* number of 512B blocks allocated */

    /* Since Linux 2.6, the kernel supports nanosecond
       precision for the following timestamp fields.
       For the details before Linux 2.6, see NOTES. */

    struct timespec st_atim;  /* time of last access */
    struct timespec st_mtim;  /* time of last modification */
    struct timespec st_ctim;  /* time of last status change */

#define st_atime st_atim.tv_sec      /* Backward compatibility */
#define st_mtime st_mtim.tv_sec
#define st_ctime st_ctim.tv_sec
};
.fi
.in
.PP
The
.I st_dev
field describes the device on which this file resides.
(The
.BR major (3)
and
.BR minor (3)
macros may be useful to decompose the device ID in this field.)

The
.I st_rdev
field describes the device that this file (inode) represents.

The
.I st_size
field gives the size of the file (if it is a regular
file or a symbolic link) in bytes.
The size of a symbolic link is the length of the pathname
it contains, without a terminating null byte.

The
.I st_blocks
field indicates the number of blocks allocated to the file, 512-byte units.
(This may be smaller than
.IR st_size /512
when the file has holes.)

The
.I st_blksize
field gives the "preferred" blocksize for efficient filesystem I/O.
(Writing to a file in smaller chunks may cause
an inefficient read-modify-rewrite.)
.PP
Not all of the Linux filesystems implement all of the time fields.
Some filesystem types allow mounting in such a way that file
and/or directory accesses do not cause an update of the
.I st_atime
field.
(See
.IR noatime ,
.IR nodiratime ,
and
.I relatime
in
.BR mount (8),
and related information in
.BR mount (2).)
In addition,
.I st_atime
is not updated if a file is opened with the
.BR O_NOATIME ;
see
.BR open (2).

The field
.I st_atime
is changed by file accesses, for example, by
.BR execve (2),
.BR mknod (2),
.BR pipe (2),
.BR utime (2)
and
.BR read (2)
(of more than zero bytes).
Other routines, like
.BR mmap (2),
may or may not update
.IR st_atime .

The field
.I st_mtime
is changed by file modifications, for example, by
.BR mknod (2),
.BR truncate (2),
.BR utime (2)
and
.BR write (2)
(of more than zero bytes).
Moreover,
.I st_mtime
of a directory is changed by the creation or deletion of files
in that directory.
The
.I st_mtime
field is
.I not
changed for changes in owner, group, hard link count, or mode.

The field
.I st_ctime
is changed by writing or by setting inode information
(i.e., owner, group, link count, mode, etc.).
.PP
The following POSIX macros are defined to check the file type using the
.I st_mode
field:
.RS 4
.TP 1.2i
.BR S_ISREG (m)
is it a regular file?
.TP
.BR S_ISDIR (m)
directory?
.TP
.BR S_ISCHR (m)
character device?
.TP
.BR S_ISBLK (m)
block device?
.TP
.BR S_ISFIFO (m)
FIFO (named pipe)?
.TP
.BR S_ISLNK (m)
symbolic link?  (Not in POSIX.1-1996.)
.TP
.BR S_ISSOCK (m)
socket?  (Not in POSIX.1-1996.)
.RE
.PP
The following flags are defined for the
.I st_mode
field:
.in +4n

S_IFMT	0170000	bit mask for the file type bit fields
S_IFSOCK	0140000	socket

.TE
.in
.P
The set-group-ID bit
.RB ( S_ISGID )
has several special uses.
For a directory it indicates that BSD semantics is to be used
for that directory: files created there inherit their group ID from
the directory, not from the effective group ID of the creating process,
and directories created there will also get the
.B S_ISGID
bit set.
For a file that does not have the group execution bit
.RB ( S_IXGRP )
set,
the set-group-ID bit indicates mandatory file/record locking.
.P
The sticky bit
.RB ( S_ISVTX )
on a directory means that a file
in that directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner
of the file, by the owner of the directory, and by a privileged
process.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied for one of the directories
in the path prefix of
.IR path .
(See also
.BR path_resolution (7).)
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is bad.
.TP
.B EFAULT
Bad address.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links encountered while traversing the path.
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.I path
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
A component of
.I path
does not exist, or
.I path
is an empty string.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Out of memory (i.e., kernel memory).
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix of
.I path
is not a directory.
.TP
.B EOVERFLOW
.I path
or
.I fd
refers to a file whose size, inode number,
or number of blocks cannot be represented in, respectively, the types
.IR off_t ,
.IR ino_t ,
or
.IR blkcnt_t .
This error can occur when, for example,
an application compiled on a 32-bit platform without
.I -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
calls
.BR stat ()
on a file whose size exceeds
.I (1<<31)-1
bytes.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These system calls conform to SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
.\" SVr4 documents additional
.\" .BR fstat ()
.\" error conditions EINTR, ENOLINK, and EOVERFLOW.  SVr4
.\" documents additional
.\" .BR stat ()
.\" and
.\" .BR lstat ()
.\" error conditions EINTR, EMULTIHOP, ENOLINK, and EOVERFLOW.

According to POSIX.1-2001,
.BR lstat ()
on a symbolic link need return valid information only in the
.I st_size
field and the file-type component of the
.IR st_mode
field of the
.IR stat
structure.
POSIX.-2008 tightens the specification, requiring
.BR lstat ()
to return valid information in all fields except the permission bits in
.IR st_mode .

Use of the
.I st_blocks
and
.I st_blksize
fields may be less portable.
(They were introduced in BSD.
The interpretation differs between systems,
and possibly on a single system when NFS mounts are involved.)
If you need to obtain the definition of the
.IR blkcnt_t
or
.IR blksize_t
types from
.IR <sys/stat.h> ,
then define
.BR _XOPEN_SOURCE
with the value 500 or greater (before including
.I any
header files).
.LP
POSIX.1-1990 did not describe the
.BR S_IFMT ,
.BR S_IFSOCK ,
.BR S_IFLNK ,
.BR S_IFREG ,
.BR S_IFBLK ,
.BR S_IFDIR ,
.BR S_IFCHR ,
.BR S_IFIFO ,
.B S_ISVTX
constants, but instead demanded the use of
the macros
.BR S_ISDIR (),
etc.
The
.BR S_IF*
constants are present in POSIX.1-2001 and later.

The
.BR S_ISLNK ()
and
.BR S_ISSOCK ()
macros are not in
POSIX.1-1996, but both are present in POSIX.1-2001;
the former is from SVID 4, the latter from SUSv2.

.TE

A sticky command appeared in Version 32V AT&T UNIX.
.SH NOTES
Older kernels and older standards did not support nanosecond timestamp
fields.
Instead, there were three timestamp 
.RI fields\(em st_atime ,
.IR st_mtime ,
and
.IR st_ctime \(emtyped
as 
.IR time_t
that recorded timestamps with one-second precision.
Since kernel 2.5.48, the
.I stat
structure supports nanosecond resolution for the three file timestamp fields.
The nanosecond components of each timestamp are available
via names of the form
.IR st_atim.tv_nsec
if the
.B _BSD_SOURCE
or
.B _SVID_SOURCE
feature test macro is defined.
Nanosecond timestamps are nowadays standardized,
starting with POSIX.1-2008, and, starting with version 2.12,
glibc also exposes the nanosecond component names if
.BR _POSIX_C_SOURCE
is defined with the value 200809L or greater, or
.BR _XOPEN_SOURCE
is defined with the value 700 or greater.
If none of the aforementioned macros are defined,
then the nanosecond values are exposed with names of the form
.IR st_atimensec .
On filesystems that do not support subsecond timestamps,
the nanosecond fields are returned with the value 0.
.\" As at kernel 2.6.25, XFS and JFS support nanosecond timestamps,
.\" but ext2, ext3, and Reiserfs do not.

On Linux,
.BR lstat ()
will generally not trigger automounter action, whereas
.BR stat ()
will (but see
.BR fstatat (2)).

For most files under the
.I /proc
directory,
.BR stat ()
does not return the file size in the
.I st_size
field; instead the field is returned with the value 0.
.SS Underlying kernel interface
Over time, increases in the size of the
.I stat
structure have led to three successive versions of
.BR stat ():
.IR sys_stat ()
(slot
.IR __NR_oldstat ),
.IR sys_newstat ()
(slot
.IR __NR_stat ),
and
.I sys_stat64()
(new in kernel 2.4; slot
.IR __NR_stat64 ).
The glibc
.BR stat ()
wrapper function hides these details from applications,
invoking the most recent version of the system call provided by the kernel,
and repacking the returned information if required for old binaries.
Similar remarks apply for
.BR fstat ()
and
.BR lstat ().
.\"
.\" A note from Andries Brouwer, July 2007
.\"
.\" > Is the story not rather more complicated for some calls like
.\" > stat(2)?
.\"
.\" Yes and no, mostly no. See /usr/include/sys/stat.h .
.\"
.\" The idea is here not so much that syscalls change, but that
.\" the definitions of struct stat and of the types dev_t and mode_t change.
.\" This means that libc (even if it does not call the kernel
.\" but only calls some internal function) must know what the
.\" format of dev_t or of struct stat is.
.\" The communication between the application and libc goes via
.\" the include file <sys/stat.h> that defines a _STAT_VER and
.\" _MKNOD_VER describing the layout of the data that user space
.\" uses. Each (almost each) occurrence of stat() is replaced by
.\" an occurrence of xstat() where the first parameter of xstat()
.\" is this version number _STAT_VER.
.\"
.\" Now, also the definitions used by the kernel change.
.\" But glibc copes with this in the standard way, and the
.\" struct stat as returned by the kernel is repacked into
.\" the struct stat as expected by the application.
.\" Thus, _STAT_VER and this setup cater for the application-libc
.\" interface, rather than the libc-kernel interface.
.\"
.\" (Note that the details depend on gcc being used as c compiler.)
