.TH PRCTL 2 2013-02-08 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
prctl \- operations on a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/prctl.h>
.sp
.BI "int prctl(int " option ", unsigned long " arg2 ", unsigned long " arg3 ,
.BI "          unsigned long " arg4 ", unsigned long " arg5 );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR prctl ()
is called with a first argument describing what to do
(with values defined in \fI<linux/prctl.h>\fP), and further
arguments with a significance depending on the first one.
The first argument can be:
.TP
.BR PR_CAPBSET_READ " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified in
.I arg2
is in the calling thread's capability bounding set,
or 0 if it is not.
(The capability constants are defined in
.IR <linux/capability.h> .)
The capability bounding set dictates
whether the process can receive the capability through a
file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to
.BR execve (2).

If the capability specified in
.I arg2
is not valid, then the call fails with the error
.BR EINVAL .
.TP
.BR PR_CAPBSET_DROP " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
If the calling thread has the
.B CAP_SETPCAP
capability, then drop the capability specified by
.I arg2
from the calling thread's capability bounding set.
Any children of the calling thread will inherit the newly
reduced bounding set.

The call fails with the error:
.B EPERM
if the calling thread does not have the
.BR CAP_SETPCAP ;
.BR EINVAL
if
.I arg2
does not represent a valid capability; or
.BR EINVAL
if file capabilities are not enabled in the kernel,
in which case bounding sets are not supported.

.TP
.BR PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER " (since Linux 3.4)"
.\" commit ebec18a6d3aa1e7d84aab16225e87fd25170ec2b
If
.I arg2
is nonzero,
set the "child subreaper" attribute of the calling process;
if
.I arg2
is zero, unset the attribute.
When a process is marked as a child subreaper, 
all of the children that it creates, and their descendants,
will be marked as having a subreaper.
In effect, a subreaper fulfills the role of
.BR init (1)
for its descendant processes.
Upon termination of a process
that is orphaned (i.e., its immediate parent has already terminated)
and marked as having a subreaper,
the nearest still living ancestor subreaper
will receive a
.BR SIGCHLD
signal and be able to
.BR wait (2)
on the process to discover its termination status.

.TP
.BR PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER " (since Linux 3.4)"
Return the "child subreaper" setting of the caller,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .

.TP
.BR PR_SET_DUMPABLE " (since Linux 2.3.20)"
Set the state of the flag determining whether core dumps are produced
for the calling process upon delivery of a signal whose default behavior is
to produce a core dump.
(Normally, this flag is set for a process by default, but it is cleared
when a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is executed and also by
various system calls that manipulate process UIDs and GIDs).
In kernels up to and including 2.6.12,
.I arg2
must be either 0 (process is not dumpable) or 1 (process is dumpable).
Between kernels 2.6.13 and 2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted,
which caused any binary which normally would not be dumped
to be dumped readable by root only;
for security reasons, this feature has been removed.

.\" From:       Marcel Holtmann <marcel () holtmann ! org>
.\" Date:       2006-07-12 11:12:00
(See also the description of
.I /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
in
.BR proc (5).)
Processes that are not dumpable can not be attached via
.BR ptrace (2)
.BR PTRACE_ATTACH .
.TP
.BR PR_GET_DUMPABLE " (since Linux 2.3.20)"
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling
process's dumpable flag.
.\" Since Linux 2.6.13, the dumpable flag can have the value 2,
.\" but in 2.6.13 PR_GET_DUMPABLE simply returns 1 if the dumpable
.\" flags has a nonzero value.  This was fixed in 2.6.14.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_ENDIAN " (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)"
Set the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given
in \fIarg2\fP, which should be one of the following:
.\" Respectively 0, 1, 2
.BR PR_ENDIAN_BIG ,
.BR PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE ,
or
.B PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE
(PowerPC pseudo little endian).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_ENDIAN " (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)"
Return the endian-ness of the calling process,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_FPEMU " (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)"
Set floating-point emulation control bits to \fIarg2\fP.
Pass \fBPR_FPEMU_NOPRINT\fP to silently emulate fp operations accesses, or
\fBPR_FPEMU_SIGFPE\fP to not emulate fp operations and send
.B SIGFPE
instead.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_FPEMU " (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)"
Return floating-point emulation control bits,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_FPEXC " (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)"
Set floating-point exception mode to \fIarg2\fP.
Pass \fBPR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE\fP to use FPEXC for FP exception enables,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_DIV\fP for floating-point divide by zero,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_OVF\fP for floating-point overflow,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_UND\fP for floating-point underflow,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_RES\fP for floating-point inexact result,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_INV\fP for floating-point invalid operation,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_DISABLED\fP for FP exceptions disabled,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV\fP for async nonrecoverable exception mode,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_ASYNC\fP for async recoverable exception mode,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_PRECISE\fP for precise exception mode.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_FPEXC " (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)"
Return floating-point exception mode,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_KEEPCAPS " (since Linux 2.2.18)"
Set the state of the thread's "keep capabilities" flag,
which determines whether the threads's permitted
capability set is cleared when a change is made to the threads's user IDs
such that the threads's real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID
all become nonzero when at least one of them previously had the value 0.
By default, the permitted capability set is cleared when such a change is made;
setting the "keep capabilities" flag prevents it from being cleared.
.I arg2
must be either 0 (permitted capabilities are cleared)
or 1 (permitted capabilities are kept).
(A thread's
.I effective
capability set is always cleared when such a credential change is made,
regardless of the setting of the "keep capabilities" flag.)
The "keep capabilities" value will be reset to 0 on subsequent calls to
.BR execve (2).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_KEEPCAPS " (since Linux 2.2.18)"
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling threads's
"keep capabilities" flag.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_NAME " (since Linux 2.6.9)"
Set the process name for the calling thread,
using the value in the location pointed to by
.IR "(char\ *) arg2" .
The name can be up to 16 bytes long,
.\" TASK_COMM_LEN in include/linux/sched.h
and should be null-terminated if it contains fewer bytes.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_NAME " (since Linux 2.6.11)"
Return the name for the calling thread,
in the buffer pointed to by
.IR "(char\ *) arg2" .
The buffer should allow space for up to 16 bytes;
the returned string will be null-terminated if it is shorter than that.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS " (since Linux 3.5)"
Set the calling process's
.I no_new_privs
bit to the value in
.IR arg2 .
With
.I no_new_privs
set to 1,
.BR execve (2)
promises not to grant privileges to do anything
that could not have been done without the
.BR execve (2)
call (for example,
rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits,
and file capabilities non-functional).
Once set, this bit cannot be unset.
The setting of this bit is inherited by children created by
.BR fork (2)
and
.BR clone (2),
and preserved across
.BR execve (2).

For more information, see the kernel source file
.IR Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt .
.TP
.BR PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS " (since Linux 3.5)"
Return the value of the
.I no_new_privs
bit for the current process.
A value of 0 indicates the regular
.BR execve (2)
behavior.
A value of 1 indicates
.BR execve (2)
will operate in the privilege-restricting mode described above.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_PDEATHSIG " (since Linux 2.1.57)"
Set the parent process death signal
of the calling process to \fIarg2\fP (either a signal value
in the range 1..maxsig, or 0 to clear).
This is the signal that the calling process will get when its
parent dies.
This value is cleared for the child of a
.BR fork (2)
and (since Linux 2.4.36 / 2.6.23)
when executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID binary.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_PDEATHSIG " (since Linux 2.3.15)"
Return the current value of the parent process death signal,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_PTRACER " (since Linux 3.4)"
.\" commit 2d514487faf188938a4ee4fb3464eeecfbdcf8eb
.\" commit bf06189e4d14641c0148bea16e9dd24943862215
This is only meaningful when the Yama LSM is enabled and in mode 1
("restricted ptrace", visible via
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope ).
When a "ptracer process ID" is passed in \fIarg2\fP,
the caller is declaring that the ptracer process can
.BR ptrace (2)
the calling process as if it were a direct process ancestor.
Each
.B PR_SET_PTRACER
operation replaces the previous "ptracer process ID".
Employing
.B PR_SET_PTRACER
with
.I arg2
set to 0 clears the caller's "ptracer process ID".
If
.I arg2
is
.BR PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY,
the ptrace restrictions introduced by Yama are effectively disabled for the
calling process.

For further information, see the kernel source file
.IR Documentation/security/Yama.txt .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_SECCOMP " (since Linux 2.6.23)"
.\" See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/542632
.\" [PATCH 0 of 2] seccomp updates
.\" andrea@cpushare.com
Set the secure computing (seccomp) mode for the calling thread, to limit
the available system calls.
The seccomp mode is selected via
.IR arg2 .
(The seccomp constants are defined in
.IR <linux/seccomp.h> .)

With
.IR arg2
set to
.BR SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT
the only system calls that the thread is permitted to make are
.BR read (2),
.BR write (2),
.BR _exit (2),
and
.BR sigreturn (2).
Other system calls result in the delivery of a
.BR SIGKILL
signal.
Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching applications
that may need to execute untrusted byte code,
perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.
This operation is only available
if the kernel is configured with
.B CONFIG_SECCOMP
enabled.

With
.IR arg2
set to
.BR SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER " (since Linux 3.5)"
the system calls allowed are defined by a pointer
to a Berkeley Packet Filter passed in
.IR arg3 .
This argument is a pointer to
.IR "struct sock_fprog" ;
it can be designed to filter
arbitrary system calls and system call arguments.
This mode is only available if the kernel is configured with
.B CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER
enabled.

If
.BR SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER
filters permit
.BR fork (2),
then the seccomp mode is inherited by children created by
.BR fork (2);
if
.BR execve (2)
is permitted, then the seccomp mode is preserved across
.BR execve (2).
If the filters permit
.BR prctl ()
calls, then additional filters can be added;
they are run in order until the first non-allow result is seen.

For further information, see the kernel source file
.IR Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt .
.TP
.BR PR_GET_SECCOMP " (since Linux 2.6.23)"
Return the secure computing mode of the calling thread.
If the caller is not in secure computing mode, this operation returns 0;
if the caller is in strict secure computing mode, then the
.BR prctl ()
call will cause a
.B SIGKILL
signal to be sent to the process.
If the caller is in filter mode, and this system call is allowed by the
seccomp filters, it returns 2.
This operation is only available
if the kernel is configured with
.B CONFIG_SECCOMP
enabled.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_SECUREBITS " (since Linux 2.6.26)"
Set the "securebits" flags of the calling thread to the value supplied in
.IR arg2 .
See
.BR capabilities (7).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_SECUREBITS " (since Linux 2.6.26)"
Return (as the function result)
the "securebits" flags of the calling thread.
See
.BR capabilities (7).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS " (since Linux 3.5)"
.\" commit 300f786b2683f8bb1ec0afb6e1851183a479c86d
Retrieve the
.I clear_child_tid
address set by
.BR set_tid_address (2)
and the
.BR clone (2)
.B CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID
flag.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_TIMERSLACK " (since Linux 2.6.28)"
.\" See https://lwn.net/Articles/369549/
.\" commit 6976675d94042fbd446231d1bd8b7de71a980ada
Set the current timer slack for the calling thread to the nanosecond value
supplied in
.IR arg2 .
If
.I arg2
is less than or equal to zero,
.\" It seems that it's not possible to set the timer slack to zero;
.\" The minimum value is 1? Seems a little strange.
reset the current timer slack to the thread's default timer slack value.
The timer slack is used by the kernel to group timer expirations
for the calling thread that are close to one another;
as a consequence, timer expirations for the thread may be
up to the specified number of nanoseconds late (but will never expire early).
Grouping timer expirations can help reduce system power consumption
by minimizing CPU wake-ups.

The timer expirations affected by timer slack are those set by
.BR select (2),
.BR pselect (2),
.BR poll (2),
.BR ppoll (2),
.BR epoll_wait (2),
.BR epoll_pwait (2),
.BR clock_nanosleep (2),
.BR nanosleep (2),
and
.BR futex (2)
(and thus the library functions implemented via futexes, including
.\" List obtained by grepping for futex usage in glibc source
.BR pthread_cond_timedwait (3),
.BR pthread_mutex_timedlock (3),
.BR pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock (3),
.BR pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock (3),
and
.BR sem_timedwait (3)).

Timer slack is not applied to threads that are scheduled under
a realtime scheduling policy (see
.BR sched_setscheduler (2)).

Each thread has two associated timer slack values:
a "default" value, and a "current" value.
The current value is the one that governs grouping
of timer expirations.
When a new thread is created,
the two timer slack values are made the same as the current value
of the creating thread.
Thereafter, a thread can adjust its current timer slack value via
.BR PR_SET_TIMERSLACK
(the default value can't be changed).
The timer slack values of
.IR init
(PID 1), the ancestor of all processes,
are 50,000 nanoseconds (50 microseconds).
The timer slack values are preserved across
.BR execve (2).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_TIMERSLACK " (since Linux 2.6.28)"
Return the current timer slack value of the calling thread.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_TIMING " (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)"
Set whether to use (normal, traditional) statistical process timing or
accurate timestamp-based process timing, by passing
.B PR_TIMING_STATISTICAL
.\" 0
or
.B PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP
.\" 1
to \fIarg2\fP.
.B PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP
is not currently implemented
(attempting to set this mode will yield the error
.BR EINVAL ).
.\" PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP doesn't do anything in 2.6.26-rc8,
.\" and looking at the patch history, it appears
.\" that it never did anything.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_TIMING " (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)"
Return (as the function result) which process timing method is currently
in use.
.TP
.BR PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE " (since Linux 2.6.31)"
Disable all performance counters attached to the calling process,
regardless of whether the counters were created by
this process or another process.
Performance counters created by the calling process for other
processes are unaffected.
For more information on performance counters, see the Linux kernel source file
.IR tools/perf/design.txt .

.TP
.BR PR_SET_TSC " (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)"
Set the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter
can be read by the process.
Pass
.B PR_TSC_ENABLE
to
.I arg2
to allow it to be read, or
.B PR_TSC_SIGSEGV
to generate a
.B SIGSEGV
when the process tries to read the timestamp counter.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_TSC " (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)"
Return the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter
can be read,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.B PR_SET_UNALIGN
(Only on: ia64, since Linux 2.3.48; parisc, since Linux 2.6.15;
PowerPC, since Linux 2.6.18; Alpha, since Linux 2.6.22)
Set unaligned access control bits to \fIarg2\fP.
Pass
\fBPR_UNALIGN_NOPRINT\fP to silently fix up unaligned user accesses,
or \fBPR_UNALIGN_SIGBUS\fP to generate
.B SIGBUS
on unaligned user access.
.TP
.B PR_GET_UNALIGN
(see
.B PR_SET_UNALIGN
for information on versions and architectures)
Return unaligned access control bits, in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_MCE_KILL " (since Linux 2.6.32)"
Set the machine check memory corruption kill policy for the current thread.
If
.I arg2
is
.BR PR_MCE_KILL_CLEAR ,
clear the thread memory corruption kill policy and use the system-wide default.
(The system-wide default is defined by
.IR /proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill ;
see
.BR proc (5).)
If
.I arg2
is
.BR PR_MCE_KILL_SET ,
use a thread-specific memory corruption kill policy.
In this case,
.I arg3
defines whether the policy is
.I early kill
.RB ( PR_MCE_KILL_EARLY ),
.I late kill
.RB ( PR_MCE_KILL_LATE ),
or the system-wide default
.RB ( PR_MCE_KILL_DEFAULT ).
Early kill means that the thread receives a
.B SIGBUS
signal as soon as hardware memory corruption is detected inside
its address space.
In late kill mode, the process is only killed when it accesses a corrupted page.
See
.BR sigaction (2)
for more information on the
.BR SIGBUS
signal.
The policy is inherited by children.
The remaining unused
.BR prctl ()
arguments must be zero for future compatibility.
.TP
.BR PR_MCE_KILL_GET " (since Linux 2.6.32)"
Return the current per-process machine check kill policy.
All unused
.BR prctl ()
arguments must be zero.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_MM " (since Linux 3.3)"
Modify certain kernel memory map descriptor fields
of the calling process.
Usually these fields are set by the kernel and dynamic loader (see
.BR ld.so (8)
for more information) and a regular application should not use this feature.
However, there are cases, such as self-modifying programs,
where a program might find it useful to change its own memory map.
This feature is available only if the kernel is built with the
.BR CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE
option enabled.
The calling process must have the
.BR CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
capability.
The value in
.I arg2
is one of the options below, while
.I arg3
provides a new value for the option.
.RS
.TP
.BR PR_SET_MM_START_CODE
Set the address above which the program text can run.
The corresponding memory area must be readable and executable,
but not writable or sharable (see
