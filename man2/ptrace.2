.SH NAME
ptrace \- process trace
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/ptrace.h>
.sp
.BI "long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request " request ", pid_t " pid ", "
.BI "            void *" addr ", void *" data );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR ptrace ()
system call provides a means by which a parent process may observe
and control the execution of another process,
and examine and change its core image and registers.
It is primarily used to implement breakpoint debugging and system
call tracing.
.LP
The parent can initiate a trace by calling
.BR fork (2)
and having the resulting child do a
.BR PTRACE_TRACEME ,
followed (typically) by an
.BR exec (3).
Alternatively, the parent may commence trace of an existing process using
.BR PTRACE_ATTACH .
.LP
While being traced, the child will stop each time a signal is delivered,
even if the signal is being ignored.
(The exception is
.BR SIGKILL ,
which has its usual effect.)
The parent will be notified at its next
.BR wait (2)
and may inspect and modify the child process while it is stopped.
The parent then causes the child to continue,
optionally ignoring the delivered signal
(or even delivering a different signal instead).
.LP
When the parent is finished tracing, it can terminate the child with
.B PTRACE_KILL
or cause it to continue executing in a normal, untraced mode
via
.BR PTRACE_DETACH .
.LP
The value of \fIrequest\fP determines the action to be performed:
.TP
.B PTRACE_TRACEME
Indicates that this process is to be traced by its parent.
Any signal
(except
.BR SIGKILL )
delivered to this process will cause it to stop and its
parent to be notified via
.BR wait (2).
Also, all subsequent calls to
.BR execve (2)
by this process will cause a
.B SIGTRAP
to be sent to it,
giving the parent a chance to gain control before the new program
begins execution.
A process probably shouldn't make this request if its parent
isn't expecting to trace it.
(\fIpid\fP, \fIaddr\fP, and \fIdata\fP are ignored.)
.LP
The above request is used only by the child process;
the rest are used only by the parent.
In the following requests, \fIpid\fP specifies the child process
to be acted on.
For requests other than
.BR PTRACE_KILL ,
the child process must
be stopped.
.TP
.BR PTRACE_PEEKTEXT ", " PTRACE_PEEKDATA
Reads a word at the location
.I addr
in the child's memory, returning the word as the result of the
.BR ptrace ()
call.
Linux does not have separate text and data address spaces, so the two
requests are currently equivalent.
(The argument \fIdata\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.B PTRACE_PEEKUSER
.\" PTRACE_PEEKUSR in kernel source, but glibc uses PTRACE_PEEKUSER,
.\" and that is the name that seems common on other systems.
Reads a word at offset
.I addr
in the child's USER area,
which holds the registers and other information about the process
(see \fI<sys/user.h>\fP).
The word is returned as the result of the
.BR ptrace ()
call.
Typically the offset must be word-aligned, though this might vary by
architecture.
See NOTES.
(\fIdata\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.BR PTRACE_POKETEXT ", " PTRACE_POKEDATA
Copies the word
.I data
to location
.I addr
in the child's memory.
As above, the two requests are currently equivalent.
.TP
.B PTRACE_POKEUSER
.\" PTRACE_POKEUSR in kernel source, but glibc uses PTRACE_POKEUSER,
.\" and that is the name that seems common on other systems.
Copies the word
.I data
to offset
.I addr
in the child's USER area.
As above, the offset must typically be word-aligned.
In order to maintain the integrity of the kernel,
some modifications to the USER area are disallowed.
.TP
.BR PTRACE_GETREGS ", " PTRACE_GETFPREGS
Copies the child's general purpose or floating-point registers,
respectively, to location \fIdata\fP in the parent.
See \fI<sys/user.h>\fP for information on
the format of this data.
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.BR PTRACE_GETSIGINFO " (since Linux 2.3.99-pre6)"
Retrieve information about the signal that caused the stop.
Copies a \fIsiginfo_t\fP structure (see
.BR sigaction (2))
from the child to location \fIdata\fP in the parent.
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.BR PTRACE_SETREGS ", " PTRACE_SETFPREGS
Copies the child's general purpose or floating-point registers,
respectively, from location \fIdata\fP in the parent.
As for
.BR PTRACE_POKEUSER ,
some general
purpose register modifications may be disallowed.
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.BR PTRACE_SETSIGINFO " (since Linux 2.3.99-pre6)"
Set signal information.
Copies a \fIsiginfo_t\fP structure from location \fIdata\fP in the
parent to the child.
This will only affect signals that would normally be delivered to
the child and were caught by the tracer.
It may be difficult to tell
these normal signals from synthetic signals generated by
.BR ptrace ()
itself.
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.BR PTRACE_SETOPTIONS " (since Linux 2.4.6; see BUGS for caveats)"
Sets ptrace options from \fIdata\fP in the parent.
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
\fIdata\fP is interpreted
as a bit mask of options, which are specified by the following flags:
.RS
.TP
.BR PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD " (since Linux 2.4.6)"
When delivering syscall traps, set bit 7 in the signal number
(i.e., deliver \fI(SIGTRAP | 0x80)\fP
This makes it easy for the tracer to tell the difference
between normal traps and those caused by a syscall.
.RB ( PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD
may not work on all architectures.)
.TP
.BR PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK " (since Linux 2.5.46)"
Stop the child at the next
.BR fork (2)
call with \fISIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_FORK\ <<\ 8\fP and automatically
start tracing the newly forked process,
which will start with a
.BR SIGSTOP .
The PID for the new process can be retrieved with
.BR PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG .
.TP
.BR PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK " (since Linux 2.5.46)"
Stop the child at the next
.BR vfork (2)
call with \fISIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK\ <<\ 8\fP and automatically start
tracing the newly vforked process, which will start with a
.BR SIGSTOP .
The PID for the new process can be retrieved with
.BR PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG .
.TP
.BR PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE " (since Linux 2.5.46)"
Stop the child at the next
.BR clone (2)
call with \fISIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE\ <<\ 8\fP and automatically start
tracing the newly cloned process, which will start with a
.BR SIGSTOP .
The PID for the new process can be retrieved with
.BR PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG .
This option may not catch
.BR clone (2)
calls in all cases.
If the child calls
.BR clone (2)
with the
.B CLONE_VFORK
flag,
.B PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK
will be delivered instead
if
.B PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK
is set; otherwise if the child calls
.BR clone (2)
with the exit signal set to
.BR SIGCHLD ,
.B PTRACE_EVENT_FORK
will be delivered
if
.B PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK
is set.
.TP
.BR PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC " (since Linux 2.5.46)"
Stop the child at the next
.BR execve (2)
call with \fISIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC\ <<\ 8\fP.
.TP
.BR PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORKDONE " (since Linux 2.5.60)"
Stop the child at the completion of the next
.BR vfork (2)
call with \fISIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE\ <<\ 8\fP.
.TP
.BR PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT " (since Linux 2.5.60)"
Stop the child at exit with \fISIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT\ <<\ 8\fP.
The child's exit status can be retrieved with
.BR PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG .
This stop will be done early during process exit when registers
are still available, allowing the tracer to see where the exit occurred,
whereas the normal exit notification is done after the process
is finished exiting.
Even though context is available, the tracer cannot prevent the exit from
happening at this point.
.RE
.TP
.BR PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG " (since Linux 2.5.46)"
Retrieve a message (as an
.IR "unsigned long" )
about the ptrace event
that just happened, placing it in the location \fIdata\fP in the parent.
For
.B PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT
this is the child's exit status.
For
.BR PTRACE_EVENT_FORK ,
.B PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK
and
.B PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE
this
is the PID of the new process.
Since Linux 2.6.18, the PID of the new process is also available
for
.BR PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE .
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.B PTRACE_CONT
Restarts the stopped child process.
If \fIdata\fP is nonzero and not
.BR SIGSTOP ,
it is interpreted as a signal to be delivered to the child;
otherwise, no signal is delivered.
Thus, for example, the parent can control
whether a signal sent to the child is delivered or not.
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.BR PTRACE_SYSCALL ", " PTRACE_SINGLESTEP
Restarts the stopped child as for
.BR PTRACE_CONT ,
but arranges for
the child to be stopped at the next entry to or exit from a system call,
or after execution of a single instruction, respectively.
(The child will also, as usual, be stopped upon receipt of a signal.)
From the parent's perspective, the child will appear to have been
stopped by receipt of a
.BR SIGTRAP .
So, for
.BR PTRACE_SYSCALL ,
for example, the idea is to inspect
the arguments to the system call at the first stop,
then do another
.B PTRACE_SYSCALL
and inspect the return value of
the system call at the second stop.
The
.I data
argument is treated as for
.BR PTRACE_CONT .
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
.TP
.BR PTRACE_SYSEMU ", " PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP " (since Linux 2.6.14)"
For
.BR PTRACE_SYSEMU ,
continue and stop on entry to the next syscall,
which will not be executed.
For
.BR PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP ,
do the same
but also singlestep if not a syscall.
This call is used by programs like
User Mode Linux that want to emulate all the child's system calls.
The
.I data
argument is treated as for
.BR PTRACE_CONT .
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored;
not supported on all architectures.)
.TP
.B PTRACE_KILL
Sends the child a
.B SIGKILL
to terminate it.
(\fIaddr\fP and \fIdata\fP are ignored.)
.TP
.B PTRACE_ATTACH
Attaches to the process specified in
.IR pid ,
making it a traced "child" of the calling process;
the behavior of the child is as if it had done a
.BR PTRACE_TRACEME .
The calling process actually becomes the parent of the child
process for most purposes (e.g., it will receive
notification of child events and appears in
.BR ps (1)
output as the child's parent), but a
.BR getppid (2)
by the child will still return the PID of the original parent.
The child is sent a
.BR SIGSTOP ,
but will not necessarily have stopped
by the completion of this call; use
.BR wait (2)
to wait for the child to stop.
(\fIaddr\fP and \fIdata\fP are ignored.)
.TP
.B PTRACE_DETACH
Restarts the stopped child as for
.BR PTRACE_CONT ,
but first detaches
from the process, undoing the reparenting effect of
.BR PTRACE_ATTACH ,
and the effects of
.BR PTRACE_TRACEME .
Although perhaps not intended, under Linux a traced child can be
detached in this way regardless of which method was used to initiate
tracing.
(\fIaddr\fP is ignored.)
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.B PTRACE_PEEK*
requests return the requested data,
while other requests return zero.
On error, all requests return \-1, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
Since the value returned by a successful
.B PTRACE_PEEK*
request may be \-1, the caller must check
.I errno
after such requests to determine whether or not an error occurred.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBUSY
(i386 only) There was an error with allocating or freeing a debug
register.
.TP
.B EFAULT
There was an attempt to read from or write to an invalid area in
the parent's or child's memory,
probably because the area wasn't mapped or accessible.
Unfortunately, under Linux, different variations of this fault
will return
.B EIO
or
.B EFAULT
more or less arbitrarily.
.TP
.B EINVAL
An attempt was made to set an invalid option.
.TP
.B EIO
\fIrequest\fP is invalid, or an attempt was made to read from or
write to an invalid area in the parent's or child's memory,
or there was a word-alignment violation,
or an invalid signal was specified during a restart request.
.TP
.B EPERM
The specified process cannot be traced.
This could be because the
parent has insufficient privileges (the required capability is
.BR CAP_SYS_PTRACE );
unprivileged processes cannot trace processes that they
cannot send signals to or those running
set-user-ID/set-group-ID programs, for obvious reasons.
Alternatively, the process may already be being traced, or be
.BR init (8)
(PID 1).
.TP
.B ESRCH
The specified process does not exist, or is not currently being traced
by the caller, or is not stopped (for requests that require that).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, 4.3BSD.
.SH NOTES
Although arguments to
.BR ptrace ()
are interpreted according to the prototype given,
glibc currently declares
.BR ptrace ()
as a variadic function with only the \fIrequest\fP argument fixed.
This means that unneeded trailing arguments may be omitted,
though doing so makes use of undocumented
.BR gcc (1)
behavior.
.LP
.BR init (8),
the process with PID 1, may not be traced.
.LP
The layout of the contents of memory and the USER area are quite OS- and
architecture-specific.
The offset supplied, and the data returned,
might not entirely match with the definition of
.IR "struct user" .
.\" See http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/8/375
.LP
The size of a "word" is determined by the OS variant
(e.g., for 32-bit Linux it is 32 bits, etc.).
.LP
Tracing causes a few subtle differences in the semantics of
traced processes.
For example, if a process is attached to with
.BR PTRACE_ATTACH ,
its original parent can no longer receive notification via
.BR wait (2)
when it stops, and there is no way for the new parent to
effectively simulate this notification.
.LP
When the parent receives an event with
.B PTRACE_EVENT_*
set,
the child is not in the normal signal delivery path.
This means the parent cannot do
.BR ptrace (PTRACE_CONT)
with a signal or
.BR ptrace (PTRACE_KILL).
.BR kill (2)
with a
.B SIGKILL
signal can be used instead to kill the child process
after receiving one of these messages.
.LP
This page documents the way the
.BR ptrace ()
call works currently in Linux.
Its behavior differs noticeably on other flavors of UNIX.
In any case, use of
.BR ptrace ()
is highly OS- and architecture-specific.
.LP
The SunOS man page describes
.BR ptrace ()
as "unique and arcane", which it is.
The proc-based debugging interface
present in Solaris 2 implements a superset of
.BR ptrace ()
functionality in a more powerful and uniform way.
.SH BUGS
On hosts with 2.6 kernel headers,
.B PTRACE_SETOPTIONS
is declared
with a different value than the one for 2.4.
This leads to applications compiled with such
headers failing when run on 2.4 kernels.
This can be worked around by redefining
.B PTRACE_SETOPTIONS
to
.BR PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS ,
if that is defined.
