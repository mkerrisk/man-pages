.TH STRSTR 3  1993-04-12 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strstr \- locate a substring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "char *strstr(const char *" haystack ", const char *" needle );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrstr()\fP function finds the first occurrence of the substring
\fIneedle\fP in the string \fIhaystack\fP.  The terminating `\\0'
characters are not compared.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrstr()\fP function returns a pointer to the beginning of the
substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
.SH BUGS
Early versions of Linux libc (like 4.5.26) would not allow
an empty argument. Later versions (like 4.6.27) work correctly,
and return \fIhaystack\fP when \fIneedle\fP is empty.
