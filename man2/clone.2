.IR Note :
There is not yet a glibc wrapper for
.BR clone3 ();
see NOTES.
.SH DESCRIPTION
These system calls
create a new ("child") process, in a manner similar to
.BR fork (2).
.PP
By contrast with
.BR fork (2),
these system calls provide more precise control over what pieces of execution
context are shared between the calling process and the child process.
For example, using these system calls, the caller can control whether
or not the two processes share the virtual address space,
the table of file descriptors, and the table of signal handlers.
These system calls also allow the new child process to be placed
in separate
.BR namespaces (7).
.PP
Note that in this manual
page, "calling process" normally corresponds to "parent process".
But see the description of
.B CLONE_PARENT
below.
.PP
This page describes the following interfaces:
.IP * 3
The glibc
.BR clone ()
wrapper function and the underlying system call on which it is based.
The main text describes the wrapper function;
the differences for the raw system call
are described toward the end of this page.
.IP *
The newer
.BR clone3 ()
system call.
.PP
In the remainder of this page, the terminology "the clone call" is used
when noting details that apply to all of these interfaces, 
.\"
.SS The clone() wrapper function
.PP
When the child process is created with the
.BR clone ()
wrapper function,
it commences execution by calling the function pointed to by the argument
.IR fn .
(This differs from
.BR fork (2),
where execution continues in the child from the point
of the
.BR fork (2)
call.)
The
.I arg
argument is passed as the argument of the function
.IR fn .
.PP
When the
.IR fn ( arg )
function returns, the child process terminates.
The integer returned by
.I fn
is the exit status for the child process.
The child process may also terminate explicitly by calling
.BR exit (2)
or after receiving a fatal signal.
.PP
The
.I stack
argument specifies the location of the stack used by the child process.
Since the child and calling process may share memory,
it is not possible for the child process to execute in the
same stack as the calling process.
The calling process must therefore
set up memory space for the child stack and pass a pointer to this
space to
.BR clone ().
Stacks grow downward on all processors that run Linux
(except the HP PA processors), so
.I stack
usually points to the topmost address of the memory space set up for
the child stack.
Note that
.BR clone ()
does not provide a means whereby the caller can inform the kernel of the
size of the stack area.
.PP
The remaining arguments to
.BR clone ()
are discussed below.
.\"
.SS clone3()
.PP
The
.BR clone3 ()
system call provides a superset of the functionality of the older
.BR clone ()
interface.
It also provides a number of API improvements, including:
space for additional flags bits;
cleaner separation in the use of various arguments;
and the ability to specify the size of the child's stack area.
.PP
As with
.BR fork (2),
.BR clone3 ()
returns in both the parent and the child.
It returns 0 in the child process and returns the PID of the child
in the parent.
.PP
The
.I cl_args
argument of
.BR clone3 ()
is a structure of the following form:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct clone_args {
    u64 flags;        /* Flags bit mask */
    u64 pidfd;        /* Where to store PID file descriptor
                         (\fIpid_t *\fP) */
    u64 child_tid;    /* Where to store child TID,
                         in child's memory (\fIpid_t *\fP) */
    u64 parent_tid;   /* Where to store child TID,
                         in parent's memory (\fIint *\fP) */
    u64 exit_signal;  /* Signal to deliver to parent on
                         child termination */
    u64 stack;        /* Pointer to lowest byte of stack */
    u64 stack_size;   /* Size of stack */
    u64 tls;          /* Location of new TLS */
};
.EE
.in
.PP
The
.I size
argument that is supplied to
.BR clone3 ()
should be initialized to the size of this structure.
(The existence of the
.I size
argument permits future extensions to the
.IR clone_args
structure.)
.PP
The stack for the child process is specified via
.IR cl_args.stack ,
which points to the lowest byte of the stack area,
and
.IR cl_args.stack_size ,
which specifies the size of the stack in bytes.
In the case where the
.BR CLONE_VM
flag (see below) is specified, a stack must be explicitly allocated
and specified.
Otherwise, these two fields can be specified as NULL and 0,
which causes the child to use the same stack area as the parent
(in the child's own virtual address space).
.PP
The remaining fields in the
.I cl_args
argument are discussed below.
.\"
.SS Equivalence between clone() and clone3() arguments
.PP
Unlike the older
.BR clone ()
interface, where arguments are passed individually, in the newer
.BR clone3 ()
interface the arguments are packaged into the
.I clone_args
structure shown above.
This structure allows for a superset of the information passed via the
.BR clone ()
arguments.
.PP
The following table shows the equivalence between the arguments of
.BR clone ()
and the fields in the
.I clone_args
argument supplied to
.BR clone3 ():

.\"
.SS The child termination signal
.PP
When the child process terminates, a signal may be sent to the parent.
The termination signal is specified in the low byte of
.I flags
.RB ( clone ())
or in
.I cl_args.exit_signal
.RB ( clone3 ()).
If this signal is specified as anything other than
.BR SIGCHLD ,
then the parent process must specify the
.B __WALL
or
.B __WCLONE
options when waiting for the child with
.BR wait (2).
If no signal (i.e., zero) is specified, then the parent process is not signaled
when the child terminates.
.\"
.SS The flags mask
.PP
Both
.BR clone ()
and
.BR clone3 ()
allow a flags bit mask that modifies their behavior
and allows the caller to specify what is shared between the calling process
and the child process.
This bit mask\(emthe
.I flags
argument of
.BR clone ()
or the
.I cl_args.flags
field passed to
.BR clone3 ()\(emis
referred to as the
.I flags
mask in the remainder of this page.
.PP
The
.I flags
mask is specified as a bitwise-OR of zero or more of
the constants listed below.
Except as noted below, these flags are available
(and have the same effect) in both
.BR clone ()
and
.BR clone3 ().
.TP
.BR CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID " (since Linux 2.5.49)"
Clear (zero) the child thread ID at the location pointed to by
.I child_tid
.RB ( clone ())
or
.I cl_args.child_tid
.RB ( clone3 ())
in child memory when the child exits, and do a wakeup on the futex
at that address.
The address involved may be changed by the
.BR set_tid_address (2)
system call.
This is used by threading libraries.
.TP
.BR CLONE_CHILD_SETTID " (since Linux 2.5.49)"
Store the child thread ID at the location pointed to by
.I child_tid
.RB ( clone ())
or
.I cl_args.child_tid
.RB ( clone3 ())
in the child's memory.
The store operation completes before the clone call
returns control to user space in the child process.
(Note that the store operation may not have completed before the clone call
returns in the parent process, which will be relevant if the
.BR CLONE_VM
flag is also employed.)
.TP
.BR CLONE_DETACHED " (historical)"
For a while (during the Linux 2.5 development series)
.\" added in 2.5.32; removed in 2.6.0-test4
there was a
.B CLONE_DETACHED
flag,
which caused the parent not to receive a signal when the child terminated.
Ultimately, the effect of this flag was subsumed under the
.BR CLONE_THREAD
flag and by the time Linux 2.6.0 was released, this flag had no effect.
Starting in Linux 2.6.2, the need to give this flag together with
.B CLONE_THREAD
disappeared.
.IP
This flag is still defined, but it is usually ignored when calling
.BR clone ().
However, see the description of
.BR CLONE_PIDFD
for some exceptions.
.TP
.BR CLONE_FILES " (since Linux 2.0)"
If
.B CLONE_FILES
is set, the calling process and the child process share the same file
descriptor table.
Any file descriptor created by the calling process or by the child
process is also valid in the other process.
Similarly, if one of the processes closes a file descriptor,
or changes its associated flags (using the
.BR fcntl (2)
.B F_SETFD
operation), the other process is also affected.
If a process sharing a file descriptor table calls
.BR execve (2),
its file descriptor table is duplicated (unshared).
.IP
If
.B CLONE_FILES
is not set, the child process inherits a copy of all file descriptors
opened in the calling process at the time of the clone call.
Subsequent operations that open or close file descriptors,
or change file descriptor flags,
performed by either the calling
process or the child process do not affect the other process.
Note, however,
that the duplicated file descriptors in the child refer to the same
open file descriptions as the corresponding file descriptors
in the calling process,
and thus share file offsets and file status flags (see
.BR open (2)).
.TP
.BR CLONE_FS " (since Linux 2.0)"
If
.B CLONE_FS
is set, the caller and the child process share the same filesystem
information.
This includes the root of the filesystem, the current
working directory, and the umask.
Any call to
.BR chroot (2),
.BR chdir (2),
or
.BR umask (2)
performed by the calling process or the child process also affects the
other process.
.IP
If
.B CLONE_FS
is not set, the child process works on a copy of the filesystem
information of the calling process at the time of the clone call.
Calls to
.BR chroot (2),
.BR chdir (2),
or
.BR umask (2)
performed later by one of the processes do not affect the other process.
.TP
.BR CLONE_IO " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
If
.B CLONE_IO
is set, then the new process shares an I/O context with
the calling process.
If this flag is not set, then (as with
.BR fork (2))
the new process has its own I/O context.
.IP
.\" The following based on text from Jens Axboe
The I/O context is the I/O scope of the disk scheduler (i.e.,
what the I/O scheduler uses to model scheduling of a process's I/O).
If processes share the same I/O context,
they are treated as one by the I/O scheduler.
As a consequence, they get to share disk time.
For some I/O schedulers,
.\" the anticipatory and CFQ scheduler
if two processes share an I/O context,
they will be allowed to interleave their disk access.
If several threads are doing I/O on behalf of the same process

for instance), they should employ
.BR CLONE_IO
to get better I/O performance.

.IP
If the kernel is not configured with the
.B CONFIG_BLOCK
option, this flag is a no-op.
.TP
.BR CLONE_NEWCGROUP " (since Linux 4.6)"
Create the process in a new cgroup namespace.
If this flag is not set, then (as with
.BR fork (2))
the process is created in the same cgroup namespaces as the calling process.
.IP
For further information on cgroup namespaces, see
.BR cgroup_namespaces (7).

.BR CLONE_NEWIPC " (since Linux 2.6.19)"
If
.B CLONE_NEWIPC
is set, then create the process in a new IPC namespace.
If this flag is not set, then (as with
.BR fork (2)),
the process is created in the same IPC namespace as
the calling process.

If
.B CLONE_NEWNET
is set, then create the process in a new network namespace.
If this flag is not set, then (as with

.BR CLONE_NEWNS " (since Linux 2.4.19)"
If
.B CLONE_NEWNS
is set, the cloned child is started in a new mount namespace,
initialized with a copy of the namespace of the parent.
If
.B CLONE_NEWNS
is not set, the child lives in the same mount
namespace as the parent.

is set, then the parent of the new child (as returned by

will be the same as that of the calling process.
.IP
If
.B CLONE_PARENT
is not set, then (as with

.IP
Note that it is the parent process, as returned by

which is signaled when the child terminates, so that
if
.B CLONE_PARENT
is set, then the parent of the calling process, rather than the
calling process itself, will be signaled.

.BR CLONE_PARENT_SETTID " (since Linux 2.5.49)"
Store the child thread ID at the location pointed to by
.I parent_tid
.RB ( clone ())
or
.I cl_args.child_tid
.RB ( clone3 ())
in the parent's memory.
(In Linux 2.5.32-2.5.48 there was a flag
.B CLONE_SETTID
that did this.)
The store operation completes before the clone call
returns control to user space.
.TP
.BR CLONE_PID " (Linux 2.0 to 2.5.15)"
If
.B CLONE_PID
is set, the child process is created with the same process ID as
the calling process.
This is good for hacking the system, but otherwise
of not much use.
From Linux 2.3.21 onward, this flag could be
specified only by the system boot process (PID 0).
The flag disappeared completely from the kernel sources in Linux 2.5.16.
Subsequently, the kernel silently ignored this bit if it was specified in the
.IR flags
mask.
Much later, the same bit was recycled for use as the
.B CLONE_PIDFD

.TP
.BR CLONE_PIDFD " (since Linux 5.2)"
.\" commit b3e5838252665ee4cfa76b82bdf1198dca81e5be

.IP
It is currently not possible to use this flag together with

If the calling process or child process calls
.BR sigaction (2)
to change the behavior associated with a signal, the behavior is
changed in the other process as well.
However, the calling process and child
processes still have distinct signal masks and sets of pending

.BR CLONE_SYSVSEM " (since Linux 2.5.10)"
If
.B CLONE_SYSVSEM
is set, then the child and the calling process share
a single list of System V semaphore adjustment
.RI ( semadj )
values (see
.BR semop (2)).
In this case, the shared list accumulates
.I semadj
values across all processes sharing the list,
and semaphore adjustments are performed only when the last process
that is sharing the list terminates (or ceases sharing the list using
.BR unshare (2)).
If this flag is not set, then the child has a separate
.I semadj
list that is initially empty.
.TP
.BR CLONE_THREAD " (since Linux 2.4.0)"
.\" Precisely: Linux 2.6.0-test8
If
.B CLONE_THREAD
is set, the child is placed in the same thread group as the calling process.
To make the remainder of the discussion of
.B CLONE_THREAD
more readable, the term "thread" is used to refer to the
processes within a thread group.
.IP
Thread groups were a feature added in Linux 2.4 to support the
POSIX threads notion of a set of threads that share a single PID.
Internally, this shared PID is the so-called
thread group identifier (TGID) for the thread group.
Since Linux 2.4, calls to
.BR getpid (2)
return the TGID of the caller.
.IP
The threads within a group can be distinguished by their (system-wide)
unique thread IDs (TID).
A new thread's TID is available as the function result
returned to the caller,
and a thread can obtain
its own TID using
.BR gettid (2).
.IP
When a clone call is made without specifying
.BR CLONE_THREAD ,
then the resulting thread is placed in a new thread group
whose TGID is the same as the thread's TID.
This thread is the
.I leader
of the new thread group.
.IP
A new thread created with
.B CLONE_THREAD
has the same parent process as the process that made the clone call
(i.e., like
.BR CLONE_PARENT ),
so that calls to
.BR getppid (2)
return the same value for all of the threads in a thread group.
When a
.B CLONE_THREAD
thread terminates, the thread that created it is not sent a
.B SIGCHLD
(or other termination) signal;
nor can the status of such a thread be obtained
using
.BR wait (2).
(The thread is said to be
.IR detached .)
.IP
After all of the threads in a thread group terminate
the parent process of the thread group is sent a
.B SIGCHLD
(or other termination) signal.
.IP
If any of the threads in a thread group performs an
.BR execve (2),
then all threads other than the thread group leader are terminated,
and the new program is executed in the thread group leader.
.IP
If one of the threads in a thread group creates a child using
.BR fork (2),
then any thread in the group can
.BR wait (2)
for that child.
.IP
Since Linux 2.5.35, the
.I flags
mask must also include
.B CLONE_SIGHAND
if
.B CLONE_THREAD
is specified
(and note that, since Linux 2.6.0,
.\" Precisely: Linux 2.6.0-test6
.BR CLONE_SIGHAND
also requires
.BR CLONE_VM
to be included).
.IP
Signal dispositions and actions are process-wide:
if an unhandled signal is delivered to a thread, then
it will affect (terminate, stop, continue, be ignored in)
all members of the thread group.
.IP
Each thread has its own signal mask, as set by
.BR sigprocmask (2).
.IP
A signal may be process-directed or thread-directed.
A process-directed signal is targeted at a thread group (i.e., a TGID),
and is delivered to an arbitrarily selected thread from among those
that are not blocking the signal.
A signal may be process-directed because it was generated by the kernel
for reasons other than a hardware exception, or because it was sent using
.BR kill (2)
or
.BR sigqueue (3).
A thread-directed signal is targeted at (i.e., delivered to)
a specific thread.
A signal may be thread directed because it was sent using
.BR tgkill (2)
or
.BR pthread_sigqueue (3),
or because the thread executed a machine language instruction that triggered
a hardware exception
(e.g., invalid memory access triggering
.BR SIGSEGV
or a floating-point exception triggering
.BR SIGFPE ).
.IP
A call to
.BR sigpending (2)
returns a signal set that is the union of the pending process-directed
signals and the signals that are pending for the calling thread.
.IP
If a process-directed signal is delivered to a thread group,
and the thread group has installed a handler for the signal, then
the handler will be invoked in exactly one, arbitrarily selected
member of the thread group that has not blocked the signal.
If multiple threads in a group are waiting to accept the same signal using
.BR sigwaitinfo (2),
the kernel will arbitrarily select one of these threads
to receive the signal.
.TP
.BR CLONE_UNTRACED " (since Linux 2.5.46)"
If
.B CLONE_UNTRACED
is specified, then a tracing process cannot force
.B CLONE_PTRACE
on this child process.
.TP
.BR CLONE_VFORK " (since Linux 2.2)"
If
.B CLONE_VFORK
is set, the execution of the calling process is suspended
until the child releases its virtual memory
resources via a call to
.BR execve (2)
or
.BR _exit (2)
(as with
.BR vfork (2)).
.IP
If
.B CLONE_VFORK
is not set, then both the calling process and the child are schedulable
after the call, and an application should not rely on execution occurring
in any particular order.
.TP
.BR CLONE_VM " (since Linux 2.0)"
If
.B CLONE_VM
is set, the calling process and the child process run in the same memory
space.
In particular, memory writes performed by the calling process
or by the child process are also visible in the other process.
Moreover, any memory mapping or unmapping performed with
.BR mmap (2)
or
.BR munmap (2)
by the child or calling process also affects the other process.
.IP
If
.B CLONE_VM
is not set, the child process runs in a separate copy of the memory
space of the calling process at the time of the clone call.
Memory writes or file mappings/unmappings performed by one of the
processes do not affect the other, as with
.BR fork (2).
.SH NOTES
.PP
One use of these systems calls
is to implement threads: multiple flows of control in a program that
run concurrently in a shared address space.
.PP
Glibc does not provide a wrapper for
.BR clone3 ();
call it using
.BR syscall (2).
.PP
Note that the glibc
.BR clone ()
wrapper function makes some changes
in the memory pointed to by
.I stack
(changes required to set the stack up correctly for the child)
.I before
invoking the
.BR clone ()
system call.
So, in cases where
.BR clone ()
is used to recursively create children,
do not use the buffer employed for the parent's stack
as the stack of the child.
.\"
.SS C library/kernel differences
The raw
.BR clone ()
system call corresponds more closely to
.BR fork (2)
in that execution in the child continues from the point of the
call.
As such, the
.I fn
and
.I arg
arguments of the
.BR clone ()
wrapper function are omitted.
.PP
In contrast to the glibc wrapper, the raw
.BR clone ()
system call accepts NULL as a
.I stack
argument (and
.BR clone3 ()
likewise allows
.I cl_args.stack
to be NULL).
In this case, the child uses a duplicate of the parent's stack.
(Copy-on-write semantics ensure that the child gets separate copies
of stack pages when either process modifies the stack.)
In this case, for correct operation, the
.B CLONE_VM
option should not be specified.
(If the child
.I shares
the parent's memory because of the use of the
.BR CLONE_VM
flag,
then no copy-on-write duplication occurs and chaos is likely to result.)
.PP
The order of the arguments also differs in the raw system call,
and there are variations in the arguments across architectures,
as detailed in the following paragraphs.
.PP
The raw system call interface on x86-64 and some other architectures
(including sh, tile, and alpha) is:
.PP
.in +4
.EX
.BI "long clone(unsigned long " flags ", void *" stack ,
.BI "           int *" parent_tid ", int *" child_tid ,
.BI "           unsigned long " tls );

On x86-32, and several other common architectures
(including score, ARM, ARM 64, PA-RISC, arc, Power PC, xtensa,
and MIPS),
.\" CONFIG_CLONE_BACKWARDS
the order of the last two arguments is reversed:

.BI "long clone(unsigned long " flags ", void *" stack ,
.BI "          int *" parent_tid ", unsigned long " tls ,
.BI "          int *" child_tid );
.EE

.PP
On the cris and s390 architectures,
.\" CONFIG_CLONE_BACKWARDS2
the order of the first two arguments is reversed:

.BI "long clone(void *" stack ", unsigned long " flags ,
.BI "           int *" parent_tid ", int *" child_tid ,
.BI "           unsigned long " tls );

On the microblaze architecture,
.\" CONFIG_CLONE_BACKWARDS3
an additional argument is supplied:

.BI "           int " stack_size , "\fR         /* Size of stack */"

.BI "             pid_t *" child_tid " */ );"
.EE
.in
.PP
The prototype shown above is for the glibc wrapper function;
for the system call itself,
the prototype can be described as follows (it is identical to the
.BR clone ()
prototype on microblaze):
.PP
.in +4
.EX
.BI "long clone2(unsigned long " flags ", void *" stack_base ,
.BI "            int " stack_size , "\fR         /* Size of stack */"

.PP
.BR __clone2 ()

.BR clone (),
except that
.I stack_base
points to the lowest address of the child's stack area,
and
.I stack_size
specifies the size of the stack pointed to by
.IR stack_base .
.SS Linux 2.4 and earlier

In the Linux 2.4.x series,
.B CLONE_THREAD
generally does not make the parent of the new thread the same
as the parent of the calling process.
However, for kernel versions 2.4.7 to 2.4.18 the
.B CLONE_THREAD
flag implied the
.B CLONE_PARENT
flag (as in Linux 2.6.0 and later).
.PP
On i386,
.BR clone ()
should not be called through vsyscall, but directly through
.IR "int $0x80" .
.SH BUGS
GNU C library versions 2.3.4 up to and including 2.24
contained a wrapper function for
.BR getpid (2)
that performed caching of PIDs.
This caching relied on support in the glibc wrapper for
.BR clone (),
but limitations in the implementation
meant that the cache was not up to date in some circumstances.
In particular,
if a signal was delivered to the child immediately after the
.BR clone ()
call, then a call to
.BR getpid (2)
in a handler for the signal could return the PID
of the calling process ("the parent"),
if the clone wrapper had not yet had a chance to update the PID
cache in the child.
(This discussion ignores the case where the child was created using
.BR CLONE_THREAD ,
when
.BR getpid (2)
.I should
return the same value in the child and in the process that called
.BR clone (),
since the caller and the child are in the same thread group.
The stale-cache problem also does not occur if the
.I flags
argument includes
.BR CLONE_VM .)
To get the truth, it was sometimes necessary to use code such as the following:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#include <syscall.h>

pid_t mypid;

mypid = syscall(SYS_getpid);
.EE
.in
.\" See also the following bug reports
.\" https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=417521
.\" http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6910
.PP
Because of the stale-cache problem, as well as other problems noted in
.BR getpid (2),
the PID caching feature was removed in glibc 2.25.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following program demonstrates the use of
.BR clone ()
to create a child process that executes in a separate UTS namespace.
The child changes the hostname in its UTS namespace.
Both parent and child then display the system hostname,
making it possible to see that the hostname
differs in the UTS namespaces of the parent and child.
For an example of the use of this program, see
.BR setns (2).
.PP
Within the sample program, we allocate the memory that is to
be used for the child's stack using
.BR mmap (2)
rather than
.BR malloc (3)
for the following reasons:
.IP * 3
.BR mmap (2)
allocates a block of memory that starts on a page
boundary and is a multiple of the page size.
This is useful if we want to establish a guard page (a page with protection
.BR PROT_NONE )
at the end of the stack using
.BR mprotect (2).
.IP *
We can specify the
.BR MAP_STACK
flag to request a mapping that is suitable for a stack.
For the moment, this flag is a no-op on Linux,
but it exists and has effect on some other systems,
so we should include it for portability.
