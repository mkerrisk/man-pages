.TH CACHEFLUSH 2 2007-05-26 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
cacheflush \- flush contents of instruction and/or data cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <asm/cachectl.h>
.sp
.BI "int cacheflush(char *" addr ", int "nbytes ", int "cache );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR cacheflush ()
flushes the contents of the indicated cache(s) for the
user addresses in the range
.I addr
to
.IR (addr+nbytes-1) .
.I cache
may be one of:
.TP
.B ICACHE
Flush the instruction cache.
.TP
.B DCACHE
Write back to memory and invalidate the affected valid cache lines.
.TP
.B BCACHE
Same as
.BR (ICACHE|DCACHE) .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR cacheflush ()
returns 0 on success or \-1 on error.
If errors are detected,
.I errno
will indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
Some or all of the address range
.I addr
to
.I (addr+nbytes-1)
is not accessible.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I cache
is not one of
.BR ICACHE ,
.BR DCACHE ,
or
.BR BCACHE .
.SH CONFORMING TO
This Linux-specific system call is only available on MIPS-based systems.
.\" FIXME This system call was only on MIPS back in 1.2 days, but
.\" by now it is on a number of other architectures (but not i386).
.\" Investigate the details and update this page.
It should not be used in programs intended to be portable.
.\" Irix 6.5 appears to have a cacheflush() syscall -- mtk
.SH BUGS
The current implementation ignores the
.I addr
and
.I nbytes
arguments.
Therefore, the whole cache is always flushed.
