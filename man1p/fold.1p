.SH NAME
fold \- filter for folding lines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBfold\fP \fB[\fP\fB-bs\fP\fB][\fP\fB-w\fP \fIwidth\fP\fB][\fP\fIfile\fP\fB...\fP\fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfold\fP utility is a filter that shall fold lines from its
input files, breaking the lines to have a maximum of
\fIwidth\fP column positions (or bytes, if the \fB-b\fP option is
specified). Lines shall be broken by the insertion of a
<newline> such that each output line (referred to later in this section
as a \fIsegment\fP) is the maximum width possible
that does not exceed the specified number of column positions (or
bytes). A line shall not be broken in the middle of a character.
The behavior is undefined if \fIwidth\fP is less than the number of
columns any single character in the input would occupy.
.LP
If the <carriage-return>s, <backspace>s, or <tab>s are encountered
in the input, and the \fB-b\fP option is
not specified, they shall be treated specially:
.TP 7
<backspace>
The current count of line width shall be decremented by one, although
the count never shall become negative. The \fIfold\fP
utility shall not insert a <newline> immediately before or after any
<backspace>.
.TP 7
<carriage-return>
.sp
The current count of line width shall be set to zero. The \fIfold\fP
utility shall not insert a <newline> immediately before
or after any <carriage-return>.
.TP 7
<tab>
Each <tab> encountered shall advance the column position pointer to
the next tab stop. Tab stops shall be at each column
position \fIn\fP such that \fIn\fP modulo 8 equals 1.
.sp
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fIfold\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
The following options shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fB-b\fP
Count \fIwidth\fP in bytes rather than column positions.
.TP 7
\fB-s\fP
If a segment of a line contains a <blank> within the first \fIwidth\fP
column positions (or bytes), break the line after
the last such <blank> meeting the width constraints. If there is no
<blank> meeting the requirements, the \fB-s\fP
option shall have no effect for that output segment of the input line.
.TP 7
\fB-w\ \fP \fIwidth\fP
Specify the maximum line length, in column positions (or bytes if
\fB-b\fP is specified). The results are unspecified if
\fIwidth\fP is not a positive decimal number. The default value shall
be 80.
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operand shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fIfile\fP
A pathname of a text file to be folded. If no \fIfile\fP operands
are specified, the standard input shall be used.
.sp
.SH STDIN
.LP
The standard input shall be used only if no \fIfile\fP operands are
specified. See the INPUT FILES section.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
If the \fB-b\fP option is specified, the input files shall be text
files except that the lines are not limited to {LINE_MAX}
bytes in length. If the \fB-b\fP option is not specified, the input
files shall be text files.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIfold\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files), and
for the determination of the width in column positions each
character would occupy on a constant-width font output device.
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP 7
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP 
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
The standard output shall be a file containing a sequence of characters
whose order shall be preserved from the input files,
possibly with inserted <newline>s.
.SH STDERR
.LP
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
None.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values shall be returned:
.TP 7
\ 0
All input files were processed successfully.
.TP 7
>0
An error occurred.
.sp
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
Default.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIcut\fP and \fIfold\fP utilities can be used to create text
files out of files with
arbitrary line lengths. The \fIcut\fP utility should be used when
the number of lines (or
records) needs to remain constant. The \fIfold\fP utility should be
used when the contents of long lines need to be kept
contiguous.
.LP
The \fIfold\fP utility is frequently used to send text files to printers
that truncate, rather than fold, lines wider than the
printer is able to print (usually 80 or 132 column positions).
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
An example invocation that submits a file of possibly long lines to
the printer (under the assumption that the user knows the
line width of the printer to be assigned by \fIlp\fP):
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBfold -w 132 bigfile | lp
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Although terminal input in canonical processing mode requires the
erase character (frequently set to <backspace>) to erase
the previous character (not byte or column position), terminal output
is not buffered and is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to parse correctly; the interpretation depends entirely
on the physical device that actually displays/prints/stores the
output. In all known internationalized implementations, the utilities
producing output for mixed column-width output assume that a
<backspace> backs up one column position and outputs enough <backspace>s
to return to the start of the character when
<backspace> is used to provide local line motions to support underlining
and emboldening operations. Since \fIfold\fP
without the \fB-b\fP option is dealing with these same constraints,
<backspace> is always treated as backing up one column
position rather than backing up one character.
.LP
Historical versions of the \fIfold\fP utility assumed 1 byte was one
character and occupied one column position when written
out. This is no longer always true. Since the most common usage of
\fIfold\fP is believed to be folding long lines for output to
limited-length output devices, this capability was preserved as the
default case. The \fB-b\fP option was added so that
applications could \fIfold\fP files with arbitrary length lines into
text files that could then be processed by the standard
utilities. Note that although the width for the \fB-b\fP option is
in bytes, a line is never split in the middle of a character.
(It is unspecified what happens if a width is specified that is too
small to hold a single character found in the input followed by
a <newline>.)
.LP
The tab stops are hardcoded to be every eighth column to meet historical
practice. No new method of specifying other tab stops
was invented.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
