.TH SETREUID 2 2004-07-04 "Linux 2.6" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
setreuid, setregid \- set real and/or effective user or group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int setreuid(uid_t " ruid ", uid_t " euid );
.br
.BI "int setregid(gid_t " rgid ", gid_t " egid );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B setreuid
sets real and effective user IDs of the current process.

Supplying a value of \-1 for either the real or effective user ID forces
the system to leave that ID unchanged.

Unprivileged processes may only set the effective user ID to the real user ID,
the effective user ID or the saved effective user ID.

POSIX: It is unspecified whether unprivileged processes may set the
real user ID to the real user ID, the effective user ID or the saved
effective user ID.

Linux: Unprivileged users may only set the real user ID to
the real user ID or the effective user ID.

Linux: If the real user ID is set or the effective user ID is set to a value 
not equal to the previous real user ID, the saved user ID will be set to the
new effective user ID.

Completely analogously,
.B setregid
sets real and effective group ID's of the current process,
and all of the above holds with "group" instead of "user".

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EPERM
The current process is not privileged
(Linux: does not have the
.B CAP_SETUID
capability in the case of
.BR setreuid (), 
or the 
.B CAP_SETGID
capability in the case of
.BR setregid ())
and a change other than (i)
swapping the effective user (group) ID with the real user (group) ID,
or (ii) setting one to the value of the other or (iii) setting the
effective user (group) ID to the value of the saved user (group) ID
was specified.
.SH NOTES
Setting the effective user (group) ID to the saved user ID is
possible since Linux 1.1.37 (1.1.38).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
BSD 4.3 (the
.B setreuid
and
.B setregid
function calls first appeared in 4.2BSD).
