.TH SWAPON 2 2004-10-10 "Linux 2.6.7" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
swapon, swapoff \- start/stop swapping to file/device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <asm/page.h>     /* to find PAGE_SIZE */
.br
.B #include <sys/swap.h>
.sp
.BI "int swapon(const char *" path ", int " swapflags );
.br
.BI "int swapoff(const char *" path );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B swapon
sets the swap area to the file or block device specified by
.IR path .
.B swapoff
stops swapping to the file or block device specified by
.IR path .
.PP
.B swapon
takes a
.I swapflags
argument.
If
.I swapflags
has the
.I SWAP_FLAG_PREFER
bit turned on, the new swap area will have a higher priority than default.
The priority is encoded as:
.br
.sp
.I "    (prio << SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_SHIFT) & SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_MASK"
.br
.PP
These functions may only be used by a privileged process (one having the
.B CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability).
.SH PRIORITY
Each swap area has a priority, either high or low.
The default priority is low.
Within the low-priority areas,
newer areas are even lower priority than older areas.
.PP
All priorities set with
.I swapflags
are high-priority, higher than default.
They may have any non-negative value chosen by the caller.
Higher numbers mean higher priority.
.PP
Swap pages are allocated from areas in priority order,
highest priority first.
For areas with different priorities,
a higher-priority area is exhausted before using a lower-priority area.
If two or more areas have the same priority,
and it is the highest priority available,
pages are allocated on a round-robin basis between them.
.PP
As of Linux 1.3.6, the kernel usually follows these rules,
but there are exceptions.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The file
.I path
exists, but refers neither to a regular file nor to a block device.
.TP
.B ENFILE
The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The file
.I path 
does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
The system has insufficient memory to start swapping.
.TP
.B EPERM
The caller does not have the
.B CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability, or all
.B MAX_SWAPFILES
(earlier 8; 32 since Linux 2.4.10) are in use.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
These functions are Linux specific and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.
The second `swapflags' argument was introduced in Linux 1.3.2.
.SH NOTES
The partition or path must be prepared with
.BR mkswap (8).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR mkswap (8),
.BR swapoff (8),
.BR swapon (8)
