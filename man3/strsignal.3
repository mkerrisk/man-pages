.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR strsignal ()
function returns a string describing the signal
number passed in the argument \fIsig\fP.
The string can only be used
until the next call to
.BR strsignal ().
.PP
The array \fIsys_siglist\fP holds the signal description strings
indexed by signal number.
The
.BR strsignal ()
function should be
used if possible instead of this array.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR strsignal ()
function returns the appropriate description
string, or an unknown signal message if the signal number is invalid.
On some systems (but not on Linux), a NULL pointer may be
returned instead for an invalid signal number.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX.1-2008.
Present on Solaris and the BSDs.
