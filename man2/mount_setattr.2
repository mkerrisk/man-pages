mount_setattr \- change mount properties of a mount or mount tree
.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.BR "#include <linux/fcntl.h>" " /* Definition of " AT_* " constants */"
.BR "#include <linux/mount.h>" " /* Definition of " MOUNT_ATTR_* " constants */"
.BR "#include <sys/syscall.h>" " /* Definition of " SYS_* " constants */"

.BI "int syscall(SYS_mount_setattr, int " dfd ", const char *" path ,
.BI "            unsigned int " flags ", struct mount_attr *" attr \
", size_t " size );
.fi
.PP
.IR Note :
glibc provides no wrapper for
.BR mount_setattr (),
necessitating the use of
.BR syscall (2).
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR mount_setattr ()
system call changes the mount properties of a mount or entire mount tree.
If
.I path
is a relative pathname,
then it is interpreted relative to
the directory referred to by the file descriptor
.IR dfd .
If
.I dfd
is the special value
.B AT_FDCWD
then
.I path
is interpreted relative to
the current working directory of the calling process.
If
.I path
is the empty string and
.B AT_EMPTY_PATH
is specified in
.IR flags ,
then the mount properties of the mount identified by
.I dfd
are changed.
.PP
The
.BR mount_setattr ()
system call uses an extensible structure
.RI ( "struct mount_attr" )
to allow for future extensions.
Any non-flag extensions to
.BR mount_setattr ()
will be implemented as new fields appended to the above structure,
with a zero value in a new field resulting in the kernel behaving
as though that extension field was not present.
Therefore,
the caller
.I must
zero-fill this structure on initialization.
Please see the "Extensibility" section under
.B NOTES
for more details.
.PP
The
.I size
argument should usually be specified as
.IR "sizeof(struct mount_attr)" .
However,
if the caller does not intend to make use of features that
got introduced after the initial version of
.I struct mount_attr
they are free to pass
the size of the initial struct together with the larger struct.
This allows the kernel to not copy later parts of the struct
that aren't used anyway.
With each extension that changes the size of
.I struct mount_attr
the kernel will expose a define of the form
.BI MOUNT_ATTR_SIZE_VER number\c
\&.
For example the macro for the size of the initial version of
.I struct mount_attr
is
.BR MOUNT_ATTR_SIZE_VER0 .
.PP
The
.I flags
argument can be used to alter the path resolution behavior.
The supported values are:
.TP
.B AT_EMPTY_PATH
If
.I path
is the empty string,
change the mount properties on
.I dfd
itself.
.TP
.B AT_RECURSIVE
Change the mount properties of the entire mount tree.
.TP
.B AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
Don't follow trailing symlinks.
.TP
.B AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT
Don't trigger automounts.
.PP
The
.I attr
argument of
.BR mount_setattr ()
is a structure of the following form:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct mount_attr {
    __u64 attr_set;    /* Mount properties to set. */
    __u64 attr_clr;    /* Mount properties to clear. */
    __u64 propagation; /* Mount propagation type. */
    __u64 userns_fd;   /* User namespace file descriptor. */
};
.EE
.in
.PP
The
.I attr_set
and
.I attr_clr
members are used to specify the mount properties that
are supposed to be set or cleared for a mount or mount tree.
Flags set in
.I attr_set
enable a property on a mount or mount tree,
and flags set in
.I attr_clr
remove a property from a mount or mount tree.
.PP
When changing mount properties,
the kernel will first clear the flags specified
in the
.I attr_clr
field,
and then set the flags specified in the
.I attr_set
field:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct mount_attr attr = {
    .attr_clr = MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC | MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV,
    .attr_set = MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY | MOUNT_ATTR_NOSUID,
};
unsigned int current_mnt_flags = mnt->mnt_flags;

/*
 * Clear all flags set in .attr_clr,
 * clearing MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC and MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV.
 */
current_mnt_flags &= ~attr->attr_clr;

/*
 * Now set all flags set in .attr_set,
 * applying MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY and MOUNT_ATTR_NOSUID.
 */
current_mnt_flags |= attr->attr_set;

mnt->mnt_flags = current_mnt_flags;
.EE
.in
.PP
The effect of this change will be a mount or mount tree that is read-only,
blocks the execution of set-user-ID and set-group-ID binaries,
but does allow to execute programs and access to devices nodes.
Multiple changes with the same set of flags requested
in
.I attr_clr
and
.I attr_set
are guaranteed to be idempotent after the changes have been applied.
.PP
The following mount attributes can be specified in the
.I attr_set
or
.I attr_clr
fields:
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY
If set in
.I attr_set
makes the mount read-only,
and if set in
.I attr_clr
removes the read-only setting if set on the mount.
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_NOSUID
If set in
.I attr_set
makes the mount not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID binaries,
and file capabilities when executing programs.
If set in
.I attr_clr
clears the set-user-ID, set-group-ID,
and file capability restriction if set on this mount.
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV
If set in
.I attr_set
prevents access to devices on this mount,
and if set in
.I attr_clr
removes the restriction that prevented accesing devices on this mount.
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC
If set in
.I attr_set
prevents executing programs on this mount,
and if set in
.I attr_clr
removes the restriction that prevented executing programs on this mount.
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_NOSYMFOLLOW
If set in
.I attr_set
prevents following symlinks on this mount,
and if set in
.I attr_clr
removes the restriction that prevented following symlinks on this mount.
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_NODIRATIME
If set in
.I attr_set
prevents updating access time for directories on this mount,
and if set in
.I attr_clr
removes the restriction that prevented updating access time for directories.
Note that
.B MOUNT_ATTR_NODIRATIME
can be combined with other access time settings
and is implied by the noatime setting.
All other access time settings are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.BR MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME " - Changing access time settings"
In the new mount API the access time values are an enum starting from 0.
Even though they are an enum in contrast to the other mount flags such as
.BR MOUNT_ATTR_NOEXEC ,
they are nonetheless passed in
.I attr_set
and
.I attr_clr
for consistency with
.BR fsmount (2),
which introduced this behavior.
.IP
Note,
since access times are an enum,
not a bitmap,
users wanting to transition to a different access time setting cannot simply
specify the access time in
.I attr_set
but must also set
.B MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME
in the
.I attr_clr
field.
The kernel will verify that
.B MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME
isn't partially set in
.IR attr_clr ,
and that
.I attr_set
doesn't have any access time bits set if
.B MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME
isn't set in
.IR attr_clr .
.RS
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_RELATIME
When a file is accessed via this mount,
update the file's last access time (atime)
only if the current value of atime is less than or equal to
the file's last modification time (mtime) or last status change time (ctime).
.IP
To enable this access time setting on a mount or mount tree,
.B MOUNT_ATTR_RELATIME
must be set in
.I attr_set
and
.B MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME
must be set in the
.I attr_clr
field.
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_NOATIME
Do not update access times for (all types of) files on this mount.
.IP
To enable this access time setting on a mount or mount tree,
.B MOUNT_ATTR_NOATIME
must be set in
.I attr_set
and
.B MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME
must be set in the
.I attr_clr
field.
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_STRICTATIME
Always update the last access time (atime)
when files are accessed on this mount.
.IP
To enable this access time setting on a mount or mount tree,
.B MOUNT_ATTR_STRICTATIME
must be set in
.I attr_set
and
.B MOUNT_ATTR__ATIME
must be set in the
.I attr_clr
field.
.RE
.TP
.B MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP
If set in
.I attr_set
creates an idmapped mount.
Since it is not supported to
change the idmapping of a mount after it has been idmapped,
it is invalid to specify
.B MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP
in
.IR attr_clr .
The idmapping is taken from the user namespace specified in
.I userns_fd
and attached to the mount.
.IP
Creating an idmapped mount allows to
change the ownership of all files located under a mount.
Thus, idmapped mounts make it possible to
change ownership in a temporary and localized way.
It is a localized change because
ownership changes are restricted to a specific mount.
All other users and locations where the filesystem is exposed are unaffected.
And it is a temporary change because
ownership changes are tied to the lifetime of the mount.
.IP
Whenever callers interact with the filesystem through an idmapped mount,
the idmapping of the mount will be applied to
user and group IDs associated with filesystem objects.
This encompasses the user and group IDs associated with inodes
and also the following
.BR xattr (7)
keys:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
.IR security.capability ,
whenever filesystem
.BR capabilities (7)
are stored or returned in the
.I VFS_CAP_REVISION_3
format,
which stores a rootid alongside the capabilities.
.IP \(bu
.I system.posix_acl_access
and
.IR system.posix_acl_default ,
whenever user IDs or group IDs are stored in
.B ACL_USER
or
.B ACL_GROUP
entries.
.RE
.IP
The following conditions must be met in order to create an idmapped mount:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
The caller must have
.I CAP_SYS_ADMIN
in the initial user namespace.
.IP \(bu
The filesystem must be mounted in the initial user namespace.
.IP \(bu
The underlying filesystem must support idmapped mounts.
Currently
.BR xfs (5),
.BR ext4 (5)
and
.B FAT
filesystems support idmapped mounts
with more filesystems being actively worked on.
.IP \(bu
The mount must not already be idmapped.
This also implies that the idmapping of a mount cannot be altered.
.IP \(bu
The mount must be a detached/anonymous mount,
i.e.,
it must have been created by calling
.BR open_tree (2)
with the
.I OPEN_TREE_CLONE
flag and it must not already have been visible in the filesystem.
.RE
.IP
Idmappings can be created for user IDs, group IDs, and project IDs.
An idmapping is essentially a mapping of a range of user or group IDs into
another or the same range of user or group IDs.
Idmappings are usually written as three numbers
either separated by white space or a full stop.
The first two numbers specify the starting user or group ID
in each of the two user namespaces.
The third number specifies the range of the idmapping.
For example, a mapping for user IDs such as 1000:1001:1 would indicate that
user ID 1000 in the caller's user namespace is mapped to
user ID 1001 in its ancestor user namespace.
Since the map range is 1,
only user ID 1000 is mapped.
It is possible to specify up to 340 idmappings for each idmapping type.
If any user IDs or group IDs are not mapped,
all files owned by that unmapped user or group ID will appear as
being owned by the overflow user ID or overflow group ID respectively.
Further details and instructions for setting up idmappings can be found in the
.BR user_namespaces (7)
man page.
.IP
In the common case the user namespace passed in
.I userns_fd
together with
.B MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP
in
.I attr_set
to create an idmapped mount will be the user namespace of a container.
In other scenarios it will be a dedicated user namespace associated with
a user's login session as is the case for portable home directories in
.BR systemd-homed.service (8)).
It is also perfectly fine to create a dedicated user namespace
for the sake of idmapping a mount.
.IP
Idmapped mounts can be useful in the following
and a variety of other scenarios:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
Sharing files between multiple users or multiple machines,
especially in complex scenarios.
For example,
idmapped mounts are used to implement portable home directories in
.BR systemd-homed.service (8)
where they allow users to move their home directory
to an external storage device
and use it on multiple computers
where they are assigned different user IDs and group IDs.
This effectively makes it possible to
assign random user IDs and group IDs at login time.
.IP \(bu
Sharing files from the host with unprivileged containers.
This allows a user to avoid having to change ownership permanently through
.BR chown (2).
.IP \(bu
Idmapping a container's root filesystem.
Users don't need to change ownership permanently through
.BR chown (2).
Especially for large root filesystems, using
.BR chown (2)
can be prohibitively expensive.
.IP \(bu
Sharing files between containers with non-overlapping idmappings.
.IP \(bu
Implementing discretionary access (DAC) permission checking
for fileystems lacking a concept of ownership.
.IP \(bu
Efficiently change ownership on a per-mount basis.
In contrast to
.BR chown (2),
changing ownership of large sets of files is instantenous with idmapped mounts.
This is especially useful when ownership of
an entire root filesystem of a virtual machine or container
is to be changed as we've mentioned above.
With idmapped mounts,
a single
.BR mount_setattr ()
system call will be sufficient to change the ownership of all files.
.IP \(bu
Taking the current ownership into account.
Idmappings specify precisely
what a user or group ID is supposed to be mapped to.
This contrasts with the
.BR chown (2)
system call which cannot by itself
take the current ownership of the files it changes into account.
It simply changes the ownership to the specified user ID and group ID.
.IP \(bu
Locally and temporarily restricted ownership changes.
Idmapped mounts allow to change ownership locally,
restricting it to specific mounts,
and temporarily as the ownership changes only apply as long as the mount exists.
In contrast,
changing ownership via the
.BR chown (2)
system call changes the ownership globally and permanently.
.RE
.PP
The
.I propagation
field is used to specify the propagation type of the mount or mount tree.
Mount propagation options are mutually exclusive,
i.e.,
the propagation values behave like an enum.
The supported mount propagation settings are:
.TP
.B MS_PRIVATE
Turn all mounts into private mounts.
Mount and unmount events do not propagate into or out of this mount point.
.TP
.B MS_SHARED
Turn all mounts into shared mounts.
Mount points share events with members of a peer group.
Mount and unmount events immediately under this mount point
will propagate to the other mount points that are members of the peer group.
Propagation here means that the same mount or unmount will automatically occur
under all of the other mount points in the peer group.
Conversely,
mount and unmount events that take place under peer mount points
will propagate to this mount point.
.TP
.B MS_SLAVE
Turn all mounts into dependent mounts.
Mount and unmount events propagate into this mount point
from a shared peer group.
Mount and unmount events under this mount point do not propagate to any peer.
.TP
.B MS_UNBINDABLE
This is like a private mount,
and in addition this mount can't be bind mounted.
Attempts to bind mount this mount will fail.
When a recursive bind mount is performed on a directory subtree,
any bind mounts within the subtree are automatically pruned
(i.e., not replicated)
when replicating that subtree to produce the target subtree.
.SH RETURN VALUE

.BR mount_setattr ()
returns zero.
On error,
\-1 is returned and
.I errno

.SH NOTES
.SS Extensibility
In order to allow for future extensibility,
.BR mount_setattr ()
along with other system calls such as
.BR openat2 (2)
and
.BR clone3 (2)
requires the user-space application to specify the size of the
.I mount_attr
structure that it is passing.
By providing this information, it is possible for
.BR mount_setattr ()
to provide both forwards- and backwards-compatibility, with
.I size
acting as an implicit version number.
(Because new extension fields will always
be appended, the structure size will always increase.)
This extensibility design is very similar to other system calls such as
.BR perf_setattr (2),
.BR perf_event_open (2),
.BR clone3 (2)
and
.BR openat2 (2).
.PP
Let
.I usize
be the size of the structure as specified by the user-space application,
and let
.I ksize
be the size of the structure which the kernel supports,
then there are three cases to consider:
.IP \(bu 3
If
.I ksize
equals
.IR usize ,
then there is no version mismatch and
.I attr
can be used verbatim.
.IP \(bu
If
.I ksize
is larger than
.IR usize ,
then there are some extension fields that the kernel supports
which the user-space application is unaware of.
Because a zero value in any added extension field signifies a no-op,
the kernel treats all of the extension fields
not provided by the user-space application
as having zero values.
This provides backwards-compatibility.
.IP \(bu
If
.I ksize
is smaller than
.IR usize ,
then there are some extension fields which the user-space application is aware
of but which the kernel does not support.
Because any extension field must have its zero values signify a no-op,
the kernel can safely ignore the unsupported extension fields
if they are all zero.
If any unsupported extension fields are non-zero,
then \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to
.BR E2BIG .
This provides forwards-compatibility.
.PP
Because the definition of
.I struct mount_attr
may change in the future
(with new fields being added when system headers are updated),
user-space applications should zero-fill
.I struct mount_attr
to ensure that recompiling the program with new headers will not result in
spurious errors at runtime.
The simplest way is to use a designated initializer:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct mount_attr attr = {
    .attr_set = MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY,
    .attr_clr = MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV
};
.EE
.in
.PP
or explicitly using
.BR memset (3)
or similar functions:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct mount_attr attr;
memset(&attr, 0, sizeof(attr));
attr.attr_set = MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY;
attr.attr_clr = MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV;
.EE
.in
.PP
A user-space application that wishes to determine which extensions the running
kernel supports can do so by conducting a binary search on
.I size
with a structure which has every byte nonzero
(to find the largest value which doesn't produce an error of
.BR E2BIG ).
