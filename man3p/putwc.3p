.SH NAME
putwc \- put a wide character on a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>

wint_t putwc(wchar_t\fP \fIwc\fP\fB, FILE *\fP\fIstream\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIputwc\fP() function shall be equivalent to \fIfputwc\fP(),
except that if it is
implemented as a macro it may evaluate \fIstream\fP more than once,
so the argument should never be an expression with side
effects.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Refer to \fIfputwc\fP() .
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Refer to \fIfputwc\fP() .
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Since it may be implemented as a macro, \fIputwc\fP() may treat a
\fIstream\fP argument with side effects incorrectly. In
particular, \fIputwc\fP(\fIwc\fP,*\fIf\fP++) need not work correctly.
Therefore, use of this function is not recommended; \fIfputwc\fP()
should be used instead.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
