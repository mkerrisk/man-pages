.TH LSEEK 2 2001-09-24 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
lseek \- reposition read/write file offset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "off_t lseek(int " fildes ", off_t " offset ", int " whence );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B lseek
function repositions the offset of the file descriptor
.I fildes
to the argument
.I offset
according to the directive
.I whence
as follows:
.TP
.B SEEK_SET
The offset is set to
.I offset
bytes.
.TP
.B SEEK_CUR
The offset is set to its current location plus
.I offset
bytes.
.TP
.B SEEK_END
The offset is set to the size of the file plus
.I offset
bytes.
.PP
The
.B lseek
function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the existing
end-of-file of the file (but this does not change the size of the file).
If data is later written at this point, subsequent reads of the data
in the gap return bytes of zeros (until data is actually written into
the gap).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
.B lseek
returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from the
beginning of the file.  Otherwise, a value of (off_t)\-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fildes
is not an open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I whence
is not one of SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END,
or the resulting file offset would be negative.
.\" Some systems may allow negative offsets for character devices
.\" and/or for remote filesystems.
.TP
.B EOVERFLOW
The resulting file offset cannot be represented in an off_t.
.TP
.B ESPIPE
.I fildes
is associated with a pipe, socket, or FIFO.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, POSIX, BSD 4.3
.SH RESTRICTIONS
Some devices are incapable of seeking and POSIX does not specify which
devices must support it.

Linux specific restrictions: using \fBlseek\fP on a tty device returns
\fBESPIPE\fP.
.\" Other systems return the number of written characters,
.\" using SEEK_SET to set the counter. (Of written characters.)
.SH NOTES
This document's use of
.I whence
is incorrect English, but maintained for historical reasons.

When converting old code, substitute values for \fIwhence\fP with the
following macros:
.PP
.TS
c c
l l.
old	new
0	SEEK_SET
1	SEEK_CUR
2	SEEK_END
L_SET	SEEK_SET
L_INCR	SEEK_CUR
L_XTND	SEEK_END
.TE
.PP
SVR1-3 returns \fBlong\fP instead of \fBoff_t\fP, BSD returns \fBint\fP.
.PP
Note that file descriptors created by
.BR dup (2)
or
.BR fork (2)
share the current file position pointer, so seeking on such files may be
subject to race conditions.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR dup (2),
.BR fork (2),
.BR open (2),
.BR fseek (3)
