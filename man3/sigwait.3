.BI " int sigwait(const sigset_t *" set ", int *" sig );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR sigwait ()
function suspends execution of the calling thread until the
delivery of one of the signals specified in the signal set
.IR set .
The function accepts the signal
(removes it from the pending list of signals),
and returns the signal number in
.IR sig .

The operation of
.BR sigwait ()
is the same as
.BR sigwaitinfo (),
except that:
.IP * 2
.BR sigwait ()
only returns the signal number, rather than a
.I siginfo_t
structure describing the signal.
.IP *
The return values of the two functions are different.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR sigwait ()
returns 0.
On error, it returns a positive error number.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
.\" Does not occur for glibc.
.I set
contains an invalid signal number.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
.BR sigwait ()
is implemented using
.BR sigtimedwait (2).
