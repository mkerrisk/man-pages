.TH PTHREAD_GETCPUCLOCKID 3 2009-02-08 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
pthread_getcpuclockid \- retrieve ID of a thread's CPU time clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <pthread.h>
.B #include <time.h>

.BI "int pthread_getcpuclockid(pthread_t " thread ", clockid_t *" clock_id);
.sp
Compile and link with \fI\-pthread\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_getcpuclockid ()
functions returns the clock ID for the CPU time clock of the thread
.IR thread .
.\" The clockid is constructed as follows:
.\" *clockid = CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID | (pd->tid << CLOCK_IDFIELD_SIZE)
.\" where CLOCK_IDFIELD_SIZE is 3.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, this function returns 0;
on error, it returns a non-zero error number.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOENT
.\" CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID not defined
Per-thread CPU time clocks are not supported by the system.
.\"
.\" Looking at nptl/pthread_getcpuclockid.c an ERANGE error would
.\" be possible if kernel thread IDs took more than 29 bits (which
.\" they currently cannot).
.TP
.B ESRCH
No thread with the ID
.I thread
could be found.
.SH VERSIONS
This function is available in glibc since version 2.2.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
When
.I thread
refers to the calling thread,
this function returns an identifier that refers to the same clock
manipulated by
.BR clock_gettime (3)
and
.BR clock_settime (3)
when given the clock ID
.BR CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID .
.SH EXAMPLE
The program below creates a thread and then uses
.BR clock_gettime (3)
to retrieve the total process CPU time,
and the per-thread CPU time consumed by the two threads.
The following shell session shows an example run:
.in +4n
.nf
$ \fB./a.out\fP
Main thread sleeping
Sub-thread starting infinite loop
Main thread consuming some CPU time...
Process total CPU time:    1.368
Main thread CPU time:      0.376
Sub-thread CPU time:       0.992
