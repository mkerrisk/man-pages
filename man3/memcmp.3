.SH NAME
memcmp \- compare memory areas
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "int memcmp(const void *" s1 ", const void *" s2 ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR memcmp ()
function compares the first \fIn\fP bytes (each interpreted as
.IR "unsigned char" )
of the memory areas \fIs1\fP and \fIs2\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR memcmp ()
function returns an integer less than, equal to, or
greater than zero if the first \fIn\fP bytes of \fIs1\fP is found,
respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first
\fIn\fP bytes of \fIs2\fP.

For a nonzero return value, the sign is determined by the sign of
the difference between the first pair of bytes (interpreted as
.IR "unsigned char" )
that differ in
.I s1
and
.IR s2 .
