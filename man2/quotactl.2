.TH QUOTACTL 2 1996-04-14 "Linux 1.3.88" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
quotactl \- manipulate disk quota
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/quota.h>
.sp
.BI "int quotactl(int " cmd ", const char *" special ", int " id ,
.BI "caddr_t " addr );
.sp
.B #include <linux/unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "_syscall4(int, quotactl, int, " cmd ", const char *, " special
.BI ", int, " id ", caddr_t, " addr );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The quota system defines for each user and/or group a soft limit
and a hard limit bounding the amount of disk space that can be
used on a given file system.  The hard limit cannot be crossed.
The soft limit can be crossed, but warnings will ensue. Moreover,
the user cannot be above the soft limit for more than one week (by default)
at a time: after this week the soft limit counts as hard limit.

The
.B quotactl
system call manipulates these quota. Its first argument is
of the form
.BI QCMD( subcmd , type )
where
.I type
is either
.B USRQUOTA
or
.B GRPQUOTA
(for user quota and group quota, respectively), and
.I subcmd
is described below.

The second argument
.I special
is the block special device these quota apply to.
It must be mounted.

The third argument
.I id
is the user or group ID these quota apply to (when relevant).

The fourth argument
.I addr
is the address of a data structure, depending on the command.

The
.I subcmd
is one of
.TP 1.1i
.B Q_QUOTAON
Enable quota. The
.I addr
argument is the pathname of the file containing
the quota for the filesystem.
.TP
.B Q_QUOTAOFF
Disable quota.
.TP
.B Q_GETQUOTA
Get limits and current usage of disk space. The
.I addr
argument is a pointer to a dqblk structure (defined in
.IR <sys/quota.h> ).
.TP
.B Q_SETQUOTA
Set limits and current usage;
.I addr
is as before.
.TP
.B Q_SETQLIM
Set limits;
.I addr
is as before.
.TP
.B Q_SETUSE
Set usage.
.TP
.B Q_SYNC
Sync disk copy of a filesystem's quota.
.TP
.B Q_GETSTATS
Get collected stats.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.B quotactl
returns 0. On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 0.9i
.B EACCES
The quota file is not an ordinary file.
.TP
.B EBUSY
.B Q_QUOTAON
was asked, but quota were enabled already.
.TP
.B EFAULT
Bad
.I addr
value.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I type
is not a known quota type. Or,
.I special
could not be found.
.TP
.B EIO
Cannot read or write the quota file.
.TP
.B EMFILE
Too many open files: cannot open quota file.
.TP
.B ENODEV
.I special
cannot be found in the mount table.
.TP
.B ENOPKG
The kernel was compiled without quota support.
.TP
.B ENOTBLK
.I special
is not a block special device.
.TP
.B EPERM
The process was not root (for the file system), and
.B Q_GETQUOTA
was asked for another
.I id
than that of the process itself, or anything other than
.B Q_GETSTATS
or
.B Q_SYNC
was asked.
.TP
.B ESRCH
.B Q_GETQUOTA
or
.B Q_SETQUOTA
or
.B Q_SETUSE
or
.B Q_SETQLIM
was asked for a file system that didn't have quota enabled.
