Global changes
--------------

Various pages
   Fabian Kreutz
       Many math pages had their synopses compressed, as per suggestion
       from Fabian Kreutz.

Various pages
    Fabian Kreutz / aeb
        Many minor content and formatting bug fixes were made to the math
        pages, following suggestions from Fabian Kreutz (who recently
        translated many of the 1.70 math pages into German) and
        Andries Brouwer.

Various pages
    mtk
        For consistency, all instances of "super-user" were changed
	to the more common "superuser".

Various pages
    Vasya Pupkin / mtk
        After a note from Vasya Pupkin, I added <errno.h> to the SYNOPSIS
        of several Section 2 pages using the _syscallN() macros.

        In addition:
            -- erroneous semicolons at the end of _syscallN() were removed
               on various pages.

            -- types such as "uint" in syscallN() declarations were changed
               to "unsigned int", etc.

            -- various other minor breakages in the synopses were fixed.

        The affected pages are:

                getdents.2
                gettid.2
                llseek.2
                mmap2.2
                modify_ldt.2
                pivot_root.2
                quotactl.2
                readdir.2
                sysctl.2
                syslog.2
                tkill.2

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

readdir.3
telldir.3
    Matthew Dempsky, mtk
        triggered by http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=283179
        The wording describing how errno is set was fixed up in these pages.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

sendfile.2
    mtk
        Adjusted descriptions of argument file types to be closer to
        2.6 reality.
        Wording and formatting changes.

ctan.3
ctanh.3
    Tony Crawford
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=270817
        Formulae on the pages should be T = S / C not T = C / S.

errno.3
    Martin Schulze, mtk
        Removed errno declaration from prototype, added notes
        on historical need for this declaration.
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=174175

aio_return.3
    as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=224953
        Changed erroneous "aio_return(2)" to "aio_return(3)".

posix_openpt.3
    mtk
        New by mtk

ptsname.3
    mtk
        Added description of ptsname_r().
        Added ERRORS.

ptsname_r.3
    mtk
        New link to ptsname.3.

shm_open.3
    Matthew Gregan
        add <fcntl.h> to synopsis
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271243

strcasecmp.3
    Marek Habersack
            .SH "CONFORMING TO"
            -BSD 4.4
            +BSD 4.4, SUSv3
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234443

strfry.3
    Joshua Kwan
        Added _GNU_SOURCE to prototype
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=213538

strftime.3
    Cartsen Hey
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276248

        Changed range for "%S" from 0..61 to 0..60.

        SUSv3 says 0..60.  I think the manual page probably says
        0..61, because that's what SUSv2 said.
        (Some other implementations' man pages also say 0..61 --
        e.g., Solaris 8 & 9, Tru64 5.1B; FreeBSD 5.1 says 0..60.)

        The glibc manual currently says 0..60.

        Given that SUSv3 says 0..60, I've changed the
        manual page to also say this:

            -The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
            +The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).
            +(The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)

sysconf.3
    Johannes Berg
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=226974
        -.BR POSIX2_FORT_RUN " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV
        +.BR POSIX2_FORT_DEV " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV

system.3
    Pedro Zorzenon
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=242638
        Noted use of _XOPEN_SOURCE to get macros <sytdlib.h>
        as for wait(2).

    mtk
        Changed name of argument from 'string' to 'command' (like POSIX).

        Noted that glibc does nowadays explicitly check for the existence
        of the shell if 'command' is NULL, rather than the older behavior
        of assuming the shell exists and always returning 1 if
        'command' is NULL.

        Other wording and formatting clean-ups.

undocumented.3
    Remove some functions names that *are* documented.

        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=236884

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

epoll_create.2
    Marko Kohtala  / mtk
        Improved various error descriptions.

epoll_wait.2
    David Lloyd / Mike Frysinger, Marko Kohtala
        Added EINTR to errors.

fcntl.2
    Jamie Lokier / mtk
        Improved discussion of F_SETOWN and F_SETSIG with respect to
        multi-threaded programs.
        Generally cleaned up the discussion of F_SETOWN.

        Updated CONFORMING TO to note that F_GETOWN and F_SETOWN are
        now in POSIX.

link.2
    mtk
        Noted discrepancy between Linux and POSIX.1 when oldpath
        is a symbolic link.
        See: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367
        and: http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/ag/msg08152.html

    Michael Haardt / mtk
        Clarified EXDEV error description: it isn't possible to link
        across mount points, even if the mount points refer to the same
        file system.

mincore.2
    mtk, after note from Gordon Jin
        Updated ERRORS.

pipe.2
    As per message from Serguei Leontiev
        Removed SVr2, AT&T, and BSD from CONFORMING TO, since
        a pipe on those systems is actually bidirectional.
        (Pipes are implemented as STREAMS on the former, and
        sockets on the latter.)

posix_fadvise.2
    mtk

        noted bug in handling of 'len' in kernels < 2.6.6.

        the same file system.

semop.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version numbers for semtimedop().

    Johan Walles, Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Added sigqueue.2 to SEE ALSO.

times.2
    mtk
        Added notes on non-standard behavior: Linux allows 'buf' to
        be NULL, but POSIX.1 doesn't specify this and it's non-portable.

uselib.2
    Andries Brouwer
        Improved DESCRIPTION; clarified distinction between
        EACCES and ENOEXEC.

bcopy.3
    Heikki Orsila
        bcopy() handles overlapping case, but memcpy() does not,
        so for consistency memmove() should be also mentioned.

getmntent_r.3
    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        New link to man3/getmntent.3.

memcpy.3
    Small wording change after suggestion from Sasa Stevanovic.

    aeb
        Improved description of read from /dev/urandom.

st.4
    Kai Makisara
        Substantial updates.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.10 ====================

Released: 2005-10-19

Global changes
--------------

The changes in this release consist *solely* of formatting fixes, with
the aim bringing greater consistency to the manual pages according to
the following rules:

-- Function name references should *always* be followed by
   parentheses, "()" (possibly containing a manual page section
   number).

-- The parentheses following a function name should *not* be
   formatted.  Thus, for example, instead of:

       .B name()

   one should write:

       .BR name ()

Much of the change was automated using two scripts:
add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh and unformat_parens.sh.
For the (possible) benefit of downstream manual page maintainers and
translators, I have placed these scripts in a new subdirectory 'scripts'.

NOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS WELL:

-- These scripts provide a computer-assisted solution to the above
   two goals.  However, they are not perfect, and their output should
   be scanned by a human.  (To see what changes the two scripts
   *would* make, without making them, use the "-n" command line option.)

-- The scripts do not fix all instances that violate the above rules:
   some manual fixes are required.  Two further scripts are provided
   to help find remaining instances of function names without
   following "()": find_dots_no_parens.sh and find_slashes_no_parens.sh.

The following changes were made:

-- add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh was applied to the pages in Sections
   2 and 3.

-- unformat_parens.sh was applied to pages in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7
   (the only sections where such changes were required).

-- further changes (not so very many) were performed by hand.
   (found places to fix with the assistance of find_dots_no_parens.sh
   and find_slashes_no_parens.sh).

Various pages
    mtk
       Most instances of the constant "NULL" are not formatted (bolded) in
       man pages, but a few are.  For consistency, formatting on "NULL" has
       been removed where it occurred.

       Many minor formatting fixes were made.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getrlimit.2
    mtk
        Added EINVAL error for rlim_cur > rlim_max when calling setrlimit().

path_resolution.2
    mtk
        Repaired discussion of capabilities and file system UID, which
        mistakenly had involved exec() in the discussion.

prctl.2
    mtk
        Removed text saying there is no library interface.  There
        is nowadays.

mkfifo.3
    mtk

    mtk
        Reworded text around PAGESIZE, noting also that
        sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) can be used.

path_resolution.2
    mtk / aeb
        Removed words "as well" (added in 2.11) from the phrase
        "and it gets these last five capabilities if its fsuid is 0 as well"
        since there are (unusual) situations in which fsuid can be 0 while
        the effective UID is not.

        Reworked (cut down) discussion of capabilities, moving part of
        it into capabilities.7

setresuid.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that setresuid() always modifies the file
        system UID, and setresgid() likewise always modifies the file
        system GID.

    mtk
        Added (brief) description of SHM_HUGETLB.

sigaltstack.2
    mtk / Martin Landers

    Brian M. Carlson  / herbert
        Change <netinet/in.h> to <arpa/inet.h> in prototype; add text
        explaining that some systems need the former header.
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=265244

capabilities.7
    mtk
        Reworked part of the discussion of exec() and capabilities.
        Added sub-section "Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities".
        Reworked discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN and file-max.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.13 ====================

Released: 2005-11-03

This release consists entirely of formatting and typographical fixes.

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Function and page cross references that were italicized were
        made bold (which is how the majority of function and page
        cross references were already done).

Various pages
    mtk
        Instances of things like "NULL-terminated string" were changed to
        "null-terminated string".

Various pages
    mtk
        Pathnames, structures, arguments, and <header-files> that were
	bold were changed to italics.

Various pages
    mtk
        Instances of the constant "NULL" that were bold-faced were made
        unformatted (which is how most instances of "NULL" were already
        formatted.)

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

New pages
---------

rexec.3
    mtk / Justin Pryzby
         This page is taken as is from the FreeBSD 5.4 distribution.
         (Not checked against Linux reality, but likely things are
         the same.)
         See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=336875

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

arch_prctl.2
    mtk
        Updated discussion about lack of prototype in glibc.

execve.2
    mtk
        Improved description of E2BIG error: it relates to the sum
        of the bytes in both environment and argument list.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Clarified parts of the discussion of file leases,
        noting effect of open(O_NONBLOCK), interruption
        by signal handler, or termination by signal in
        lease breaker.  In response to
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339037

stat.2
    mtk / Stefan Brüns
        Added LINUX NOTES describing nanosecond timestamps.

frexp.3
    Volker Reichelt / mtk
        Fixed to point out that that frexp() returns a number whose
        *absolute* value is >= 0.5 and < 1.  Amended the example
        program to demonstrate this.

open.2
    mtk / Avery Pennarun
        Add EWOULDBLOCK error for file leases.
        In response to
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339037

putenv.3
    mtk
        Although the glibc implementation returns -1 on error (and some
        other man pages (e.g., the BSDs) also document that value for
        error returns), SUSv3 merely says "non-zero" (and this is
        what manual pages on many implementations also say).

posix_memalign.3
    mtk
        Formerly, the page said that all systems declare memalign() in
        <malloc.h>.  In fact, many declare it in <stdlib.h>.

strtok.3
    mtk
        Almost a complete rewrite after Angelo pointed out
        that the existing page was deficient.

sd.4
    Martin Schulze
        Remove SEE ALSO for non-existent scsi.4.

proc.5
    mtk
        Updated discussion of /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max.

signal.7
    mtk
        Added pthreads.7 to SEE ALSO.

Global changes
--------------

Most pages
    mtk
        There was a major reworking of the CONFORMING TO sections
        in most manual pages.

        * generally try to rationalize the names used for standards.
          The preferred names are now documented as the head words
          of the list in standards(7).  For the future: there is
          probably no need to talk about anything more than
          C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001 (or later), xBSD, and SVr4.
          (In particular, I've eliminated most references to XPG
          and SVID, replacing them with references to SUS or SVr4.)

        * eliminate discussion of errors that can occur on other
          systems.  This information exists only patchily in the
          manual pages, is probably of limited use, is hard to maintain,
          and was in some cases simply wrong (and probably always was).

        * Tried to ensure that those interfaces specified in C99 or
          POSIX.1-2001 are marked as such in their manual pages.

intro.1
intro.2
intro.3
intro.4
intro.5

Various pages
    mtk
        Changed instances of "DG-UX to "DG/UX"

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

New pages

    mtk
        Based on material taken from intro.2, but expanded to
        include discussion of many additional standards.

Changes to individual pages

bind.2
    mtk
         Minor wording change for ENOTSOCK error.

rtc.4
    David Brownell

        Update the RTC man page to reflect the new RTC class framework:

        - Generalize ... it's not just for PC/AT style RTCs, and there
          may be more than one RTC per system.

        - Not all RTCs expose the same feature set as PC/AT ones; most
          of these ioctls will be rejected by some RTCs.

        - Be explicit about when {A,P}IE_{ON,OFF} calls are needed.

        - Describe the parameter to the get/set epoch request; correct
          the description of the get/set frequency parameter.

        - Document RTC_WKALM_{RD,SET}, which don't need AIE_{ON,OFF} and
          which support longer alarm periods.

        - Hey, not all system clock implementations count timer irqs any
          more now that the new RT-derived clock support is merging.

places.  (Special thanks to Nicolas Franois!)


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    mtk
        Since 2.6.20, access() honors the MS_NOEXEC mount flag.
    Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto / mtk
        Improve ENOENT description.

clone.2
    mtk
        Added some detail to the prototype.
        Added some notes on IA-64's clone2().

epoll_ctl.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that EPOLLRDHUP appeared in kernel 2.6.17.

faccessat.2
    Justin Pryzby
        Various fixes as per
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411177
        * s/effective/real/ in description text.
        * added <fcntl.h> to synopsis.
        * various other changes.

getrlimit.2
    mtk / Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Added a few words to note that RLIMIT_NPROC is really a limit on
        threads.

io_cancel.2
io_destroy.2
io_getevents.2
io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s%linux/aio.h%libaio.h% in SYNOPSIS.
        Changed return type from "long" to "int".

mbind.2
    Samuel Thibault / mtk
        Fix EINVAL description.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411777

mincore.2
    Nick Piggin
        Kernel 2.6.21 fixes several earlier bugs in mincore().
    Nick Pollitt
        Remove words "of a file" -- mincore() is describing
        memory residence information, not properties of a file.
    mtk
        Rewrote various parts to make the page clearer.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Rewrote and reorganized various parts to be clearer.
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Removed text stating that mmap() never returns 0; that's
        not true.

mount.2
    mtk / Val Henson
        Document MS_RELATIME, new in Linux 2.6.20.

open.2
    Andre Majorel / mtk
        On Linux, the error returned when opening a large file on a
        32-bit system is actually EFBIG, not EOVERFLOW.

posix_fadvise.2
    Pdraig Brady
        Fix RETURN VALUE description: returns error number of failure.

rename.2
    mtk / Timo Sirainen
        Various improvements to DESCRIPTION.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=416012

semop.2
    mtk
        If sops contains multiple operations, then these are performed
        in array order.  All Unix systems that I know of do this,
        and some Linux applications depend on this behavior.  SUSv3
        made no explicit statement here, but SUSv4 will explicitly
        require this behavior.
        Small rewording of explanation of "atomically".

signal.2
    Nicolas Franois
        Fix incorrect argument name in DESCRIPTION.
    mtk
        Small wording improvement.

socket.2
    Nicolas Franois
        Add reference to ipv6.7 page.

socketcall.2
    Nicolas Franois
        Fix .TH line.

splice.2
    Benjamin Gilbert
        Fix inconsistent argument names in SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION.

statvfs.2
    mtk
        Small wording clarification.

symlink.2
    mtk / Nicolas Franois
        Removed cryptic text under CONFORMING to referring to
        "open(2) and NFS".  There is no relevant text in open.2 as
        far as I (mtk) can see.

time.2
    mtk / Reuben Thomas
        Remove sentence "gettimeofday() obsoleting time() on 4.3BSD".
        This information is old, and probably no longer relevant.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=403888

write.2
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified discussion of /count == 0/ case.

ptrace.2
    Chuck Ebbert
        When the parent receives an event with PTRACE_EVENT_* set,
        the child is not in the normal signal delivery path.  This
        means the parent cannot do ptrace(PTRACE_CONT) with a signal
        or ptrace(PTRACE_KILL).  kill() with a SIGKILL signal can be
        used instead to kill the child process after receiving one
        of these messages.

sched_setaffinity.2
    mtk
        Fix glibc version number in description of 'cpusetsize' argument.

vfork.2
    mtk
        Stripped some excess/outdated text from the BUGS section.

basename.3
    mtk / Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto
        Add text to clarify that the pointer returned by these
        functions may be into some part of 'path'.

dlopen.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
    + Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" to example program.

fclose.3
    mtk
        Complete rewrite.  The existing page was hard to read,
        and the RETURN VALUE description seems to be wrong.

getopt.3
    mtk
        Added getopt() example program.
    mtk
        Add a few words to clarify the operation of the GNU-specific
        double-colon feature, which allows options to have optional
        arguments.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=352139

glob.3
    Nicolas Franois
        Fix PROTOTYPE.

inet_network.3
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified description of inet_network().

log.3
    Nicolas Franois
        Fix .TH line.

log10.3
    Nicolas Franois
        Fix .TH line.

malloc.3
    Nicolas Franois
        Small rewording to mention calloc().

posix_openpt.3
    Martn Ferrari
        Fix return type in SYNOPSIS; as per
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400971
        Needs _XOPEN_SOURCE == 600; as per
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400975
    Julien BLACHE
        s/ptsname/posix_openpt/ in RETURN VALUE

re_comp.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Add "#define _REGEX_RE_COMP" to SYNOPSIS.

regex.3
    Nicolas Franois
        Fix .TH line.

termios.3
    mtk
        Added .SS headers to give some structure to this page; and a small
        amount of reordering.
    mtk
        Added a section on canonical and non-canonical mode.
    mtk
        Enhanced the discussion of "raw" mode for cfmakeraw().
    mtk
        Document CMSPAR.
    mtk
        Make description of PARODD a little clearer.
    Reuben Thomas
        Add SEE ALSO link to tty_ioctl.4
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO link to console_ioctl.4

ualarm.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

usleep.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s/curses/ncurses/ under SEE ALSO

bootparam.7
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Documented "mem=nopentium".

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        The default treatment of _POSIX_C_SOURCE changed in glibc 2.4.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Justin Pryzby
        Added some text warning that the "__" macros that
        <features.h> defines internally should never be
        directly defined by programs.
    mtk, based on notes by Jakub Jelinek
        Document _FORTIFY_SOURCE
        (See http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html )
    mtk
        Document _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE.

mdoc.7
    mtk / Nicolas Franois
        Remove CONFIGURATION section, since this does not seem to be
        true for Linux.

svipc.7
    Nicolas Franois
        Fix data types in associated data structures;
        remove non-existent semzcnt and semncnt fields.

time.7
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.20, the software clock can also be 300 HZ.

        Bug filed (http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408)

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.50 ====================

Released: 2007-05-21

Contributors
------------

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Andreas Halter <halter@google.com>
Laird Shaw <netocrat@dodo.com.au>
Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

Apologies if I missed anyone!

Removed pages (!)
-----------------

Most Section 1 man pages are removed
    mtk (with help from Mike Frysinger, Laird Shaw, Andreas Halter)
        Once upon time Andries added a number of Section 1 manual pages
        to man-pages.  However, since that time, those pages have not
        seen much maintenance, and are not in fact distributed in most
        distributions.  Instead most distributions supply the
        coreutils versions of these pages, which are currently
        maintained.  In addition, man-pages provides the 1p pages,
        which document the portable subset of functionality of these
        commands.  Since the man1 pages are mostly unneeded, and
        out of date, I'm removing them.  The following pages disappear:

            chgrp.1
            chmod.1
            chown.1
            cp.1
            dd.1
            df.1
            diff.1
            dir.1
            dircolors.1
            du.1
            install.1
            ln.1
            ls.1
            mkdir.1
            mkfifo.1
            mknod.1
            mv.1
            rm.1
            rmdir.1
            touch.1
            vdir.1

        The following Section 1 pages will be kept:

            intro.1
            ldd.1
            time.1


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.51 ====================

Released: 2007-05-28

Global changes
--------------

Various pages

Various pages
    mtk
        Convert function formatting of the form "\fBname\fP()" to
        ".BR name ()".

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.52 ====================

Released: 2007-05-29

    "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines"

         Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

    "But damn it, these man pages are a mess!"


Global changes
--------------

Most of the changes below are about bringing greater consistency
to manual pages, including reducing the wide range of .SH
Section headings.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Make 'manual' component of .TH line into the string
	"Linux Programmer's Manual".
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Changed date in .TH line into form YYYY-DD-MM.
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Some .SH header lines were made into .SS lines.  (One of the aims
        here is to reduce the number of non-standard .SH lines.)

Various pages
    mtk
        Change title .SH sections named "NOTE" to "NOTES", in some cases
        also changing the location of the section within the page.
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Commented out .SH AUTHOR sections; the right place for
        documentation authorship sections is usually comments at the
        top of the page source.

Various pages
    mtk
        Changed .SH HISTORY to .SH VERSIONS.
        Reason: in many cases, HISTORY was being used to describe
        Linux/glibc version information, as was already done for
        VERSIONS sections in other pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Removed HISTORY section, or moved it as a subsection or paragraphs
        under another section e.g., NOTES.
        Reason: there are too many arbitrary section (.SH) names, and
        a HISTORY section never was consistently used across Linux
        manual pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Moved SEE ALSO section to be last section on the page
        Reason: consistency -- and this is where SEE ALSO should be!

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated GLIBC NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated LINUX NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "AVAILABILITY" sections to "VERSIONS".
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "DIAGNOSTICS" sections to "RETURN VALUE".
        Reason: consistency.

getopt.3
tzselect.8
    mtk
        s/\.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES/.SH ENVIRONMENT/
        Reason: consistency.

intro.2
select.2
sysctl.2

getpwent_r.3

hsearch.3
rtime.3
strptime.3
tsearch.3
vcs.4
wordexp.3
    mtk
        s/return 0/exit(EXIT_FAILURE)/ in main() of function example
        program.
        Reason: consistency.

mprotect.2
select_tut.2
dlopen.3
getgrent_r.3
getopt.3
getpwent_r.3
hsearch.3
select_tut.2
tsearch.3
    mtk
        Use symbolic constants (EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE) in calls
        to exit().
        Reason: consistency.

access.2
chown.2
lseek.2
open.2
read.2
utmp.5
    mtk
        Renamed RESTRICTIONS section to NOTES, or moved text in a
        RESTRICTIONS section under existing NOTES section.
        Reason: consistency, and reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH)
        names.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

capget.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH FURTHER INFORMATION/.SH NOTES/

dup.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH WARNING/.SH NOTES/

kill.2
    Renamed LINUX HISTORY section to LINUX NOTES, and relocated
    within page.

select_tut.2
    mtk
        Relocated example program and made its .SH title "EXAMPLE".

sigaltstack.2
    mtk
        Move code example into its own EXAMPLE section.

sigreturn.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH WARNING/.SH NOTES/

setuid.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH "LINUX-SPECIFIC REMARKS"/.SH LINUX NOTES/

shmget.2
    mtk
        Remove section about effect of fork()/exec()/exit(); shmop.2
        contains the same text, and it only needs to be said once.

shmop.2
    mtk
         Minor rewording under DESCRIPTION.

daemon.3
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

encrypt.3
    mtk
        Removed statement that glibc unconditionally exposes declarations
        of encrypt() and setkey(), since portable applications must
        use <unistd.h> and define _XOPEN_SOURCE to obtain the declarations
        of setkey() and encrypt().  Adjusted example program accordingly.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Slight rewording.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

man.7
    mtk
        Substantial rewrite, revising and extending the discussion
        about desired conventions for writing pages.
        There will be further updates to this page in the next few
        man-pages releases.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.53 ====================

Released: 2007-05-30

    "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines"

         Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

    "But damn it, these man pages are a mess!"


Global changes
--------------

Many many pages
    mtk
        Reordered sections to be more consistent, in some cases renaming
        sections or shifting paragraphs between sections.

man7/*
    mtk
        In various pages in this section, .SH headings were
        converted to .SS.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.54 ====================

Released: 2007-06-07

Contributors

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Emmanuel Mogenet <emogenet@google.com>
Michael Berg <michaeljberg@gmail.com>

Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    mtk
        Where there is an instruction in the SYNOPSIS about linking
        or compiling with a certain option, the option is now
        marked up in italics (e.g., "\fI-lm\fP").

Various pages
    mtk
        Added page numbers to page cross references.

A few pages
    mtk
        s/manpage/man page/, for consistency.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


New pages
---------

man-pages.7
    mtk
        A description of the conventions that should be followed
        when writing pages for the man-pages package.

Removed pages
-------------

man1/README
    mtk
        Already deleted most of the man1 pages previously, so
        this doesn't need to stay.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Removed this page since it is out of date, and the proper place
        to go for up-to-date information is http://www.tldp.org/

ksoftirq.9
    mtk
        Reason: this was the only Section 9 page, and it is old
        (Linux 2.4).  The man9 section never took off as an idea, and
        I see little point in keeping a Section 9 with just a single
        old page.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

HOWTOHELP
    mtk
        Moved some material out of here into new man-pages.7.

alloc_hugepages.2
    mtk
        Minor rewrites, eliminating some duplication, and removing
        some outdated text.

epoll_pwait.2
    Michael Berg
        Fix broken link path;
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=425570

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Remove misleading text about setting O_ASYNC when calling
        open(); one must use fcntl() F_SETFL for this task.

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Converted outdated BUGS note about fdatasync() being
        equivalent to fsync() on Linux 2.2 into a NOTES note
        about this historical behavior.

futex.2
    mtk
        Small rewording to fix "fails with the error EWOULDBLOCK"
        rather than "returns EWOULDBLOCK".
        See Red Hat bug 172828.

mprotect.2
    mtk, after an observation by Emmanuel Mogenet
        A much improved example program.
    mtk
        Significant rewrites and additions to description.

mremap.2

        much information, in my opinion.

sched_yield.2
    mtk
        Added ERRORS section.

set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
        Moved text for "Versions and Library Support".

set_tid_address.2
    mtk
        Small rewording in RETURN VALUE section.

sigaction.2
    mtk
        Add EXAMPLE section with a pointer to example in mprotect.2.

        Rewrite and substantial additional text.

exec.3
    mtk
        Minor clarifications for text on execlp() and execvp().  Removed
        FILES section, since it provides no useful additional info.

fenv.3
    mtk
        Moved link instructions from NOTES to SYNOPSIS.
        Added feenableexcept, fedisableexcept, fegetexcept
        to .SH NAME list.

fputwc.3
    mtk
        Added 'putwc' to .SH NAME list.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        s/int/socklen_t/ for type of gethostbyaddr() 'len' argument,
        and add a few more words in NOTES about the type used here.

login.3
    mtk
        Removed remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil; add
        text on that point to SYNOPSIS.

openpty.3
    mtk
        Removed redundant remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil
        since there is text on that point under SYNOPSIS.

sysconf.3
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to getconf(1).

unlocked_stdio.3
    mtk
        Revised .SH NAME section.

ascii.7
    mtk
        Minor rearrangement of order of text.

capabilities.7
    mtk
        s/exec()/execve(2)/ in various places.

complex.7
    mtk
        Changed "atan(1)" to "atan(1.0)" to prevent some versions of
        man2html(1) from mistaking that string as a page cross reference.

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Small restructuring to avoid 'cannot adjust line' from man(1).

ldconfig.8
    mtk
        Removed now very out-of-date sentence about need to link shared
        libraries with -lc.

man.7
    mtk
        Various text was moved out of this page into the new man-pages.7.

mdoc.7
    mtk
         Added SEE ALSO referring to new man-pages.7.

mdoc.samples.7
    mtk
         A few changes, hopefully done right, to eliminate some
         errors to stderr when rendering with man(1).

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Shorten a line in table so it fits in 80 columns.
        Minor rewording under BUGS.

tzselect.8
    mtk
        Moved EXIT STATUS section.

        have gone away,

Several pages
    mtk
        Change reference to path_resolution.2 to path_resolution.7.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Moved pages
-----------

path_resolution.2 has been moved to section 7, thus path_resolution.7
    mtk
        Reason: this is an overview page, not one describing as
        a specific system call.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

        Added pointer to Red Hat man-pages bugzilla.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.56 ====================

Released: 2007-06-11

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    mtk
        Removed version numbers in .TH lines.
        Reason: these were only arbitrarily updated, and so impart no
        useful information.  Version information goes into a
        VERSIONS section nowadays, and the date in the .TH line should
        be updated to reflect the date of the last (significant)
        change to the page.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.59 ====================

Released: 2007-06-25

Global changes
--------------

Manual pages are now standardized on American spelling.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences
for more information on the differences.  Formerly, different pages (and
sometimes even a single page!) employed American and British spelling
conventions; best to standardize on one spelling, and American English
is the standard in Computer Science.

New pages
---------

sgetmask.2
    mtk
        A real man page for sgetmask(2) and ssetmask(2).
        (This page replaces a previous link of the same name, which
        linked to signal.2.)

spu_create.2
    Arnd Bergmann with additional work by Eduardo M. Fleury and mtk
        Document the PowerPC SPU spu_create() system call.
        (Originally taken from the kernel source file
        Documentation/filesystems/spufs.txt.)

Removed Pages
-------------

__clone.2
    mtk
        This file was created by accident in 2.61, as a copy of clone.2.
        (it should have been a link to clone.2.)

obsolete.2
    mtk
        Details on this page are covered in syscalls.2 and in
        respective syscall man pages (stat.2, uname.2).

undocumented.2
    mtk
        This page is very out of date, and in any case difficult
        to maintain.  Information about undocumented system calls
        is maintained in the HOWTOHELP file, and probably in other
        places soon.

killpg.3
    mtk
        This rather incomplete page seems unnecessary since there
        is a killpg.2.

    mtk
        Update SYNOPSIS to reflect the fact that fchmod(2) and lchown(2)
        need either "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500" or "#define _BSD_SOURCE".
        Added an example program.

killpg.2
    mtk
        Note that killpg() is actually a library function on Linux.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Added note that glibc mmap() wrapper nowadays invokes mmap2().

mmap2.2
    Ivana Varekova / mtk
        On most platforms the unit for 'offset' is 4096 bytes, not
        the system page size.

        top of sigtimedwait().

ssetmask.2
    mtk
        Make this link point to new sgetmask.2 instead of signal.2.

stat.2
    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that
        have appeared over time.

syscalls.2
    mtk
        A fairly substantial rewrite of this page,
        bringining it up to date with the current
        kernel version, and listing all system calls
        in tabular form.

uname.2
    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that
        have appeared over time.

        Add section numbers to function names; remove some functions
        since they are documented.

proc.5
    mtk
        Update/correct text on /proc/malloc.
    mtk, after a note by Pierre Habouzit, and a few comments by Justin Pryzby
        Update description of /proc/PID/stat to match 2.6.21.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=417933

inotify.7
    mtk
        IN_DONT_FOLLOW and IN_ONLYDIR are only available from 2.6.15.

    Stepan Kasal / mtk
        Note SIGRTMIN value depends on glibc.
    mtk
        Various rewrites and additions to the text in real-time signals.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

mq_notify.2
mq_open.2
mq_timedreceive.2
mq_timedsend.2
mq_unlink.2
    mtk
        Fix broken link

setpgid.2
    mtk
        Fairly substantial changes and corrections, including adding
        coverage of all of the interfaces that get/set PGIDs.

syscalls.2
    mtk / aeb
        Various rewordings; clear up some imprecisions.

lgamma.3
    mtk
        Added 'signgam' to SYNOPSIS and NAME line.

strerror.3
    mtk
        Note that the XPG version is provided since glibc 2.3.4.
        The page formerly said that the GNU-specific version
        is provided by default.  That certainly isn't true
        nowadays, since _POSIX_C_SOURCE is set to 200112L by
        default, so that the XSI-compliant version is supplied
        by default.

man-pages.7
    mtk
        Added note pointing to feature_test_macros.7 for a description
        of how feature test macro requirements should be specified in
        manual pages.  Various other minor fixes and changes.

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        Added note about how feature test macros are specified
        in manual pages.
        Many other corrections, improvements, additions, and
        details about differences across glibc versions.

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Use 'glibc' consistently to refer to GNU C library.

Various pages
    mtk
        Order errors under ERRORS alphabetically.

Various pages
    Nicolas Franois
        Spelling and formatting fixes, as per
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=439560

intro.2
select.2
fmtmsg.3
getgrent_r.3
envz_add.3
rtime.3
strptime.3
wordexp.3
    Maxime Vaudequin
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" (to declare exit(3)) to example program.


New pages
---------

timeradd.3
    mtk
        Description of timeradd(), timersub(), timerclear(),
        timerisset(), timercmp() macros for operating on
        struct timeval.


Removed pages
-------------

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Somehow, over time, material on fdatasync(2) crept into
        fsync.2, and fdatasync also got added to the NAME section
        of fsync.2.  All of the material in fdatasync.2 that was
        not already in fsync.2 has now been moved there, and
        the former page has been removed.
        In place of the content there, is now a link to fsync.2.


New links
---------

clock_getres.2
clock_gettime.2
clock_settime.2
    mtk

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

Makefile
    Mike Frysinger
        Make the install target of man-pages respect the standard
        "DESTDIR" variable as well as check the exit status of the
        install command so errors aren't ignored.

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" through out the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        removed cautionary note that use of MPOL_F_NODE|MPOL_F_ADDR
        is not supported.  This is no longer true.

        added mmap(2) to SEE ALSO list.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.22, Linux setitimer() now conforms to POSIX.1,
        giving an EINVAL error for a non-canonical tv_usec value.

gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        Replace discussion of timer* macros with a pointer
        to new page timeradd.3.

ioctl_list.2

        Fixed argument type for BLKGETSIZE.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" throughout the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files and shared
            memory regions, including SHM_HUGE regions.

            defined how "empty set of nodes" specified and what this
            means for MPOL_PREFERRED.

            mention what happens if local/target node contains no
            free memory.

            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        added mmap(2), shmget(2), shmat(2) to SEE ALSO list.

mprotect.2
    Franois Diakhate
        Add text noting that PROT_WRITE may (and on x86 does)

    mtk
        Removed SEE ALSO reference to nonexistent fadvise.2.

reboot.2
    mtk
        Place SYNOPSIS comments inside C comments (/* ... */).

sched_setaffinity.2
    Samuel Thibault
        Note what thread is affected if 'pid' is specified
        as 0, or as the value returned by getpid().

sched_setscheduler.2
    Carsten Emde
        Add text on real-time features of mainline Linux kernel.

select_tut.2
    mtk
        sync SYNOPSIS with select.2

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" throughout the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files.

            means for MPOL_PREFERRED.

            mention what happens if local/target node contains no
            free memory.

            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        added mmap(2) to SEE ALSO list.

    mtk
        Improve description of num_threads field under /proc/PID/stat.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        Fix path error (s%proc/sys%proc/sys/kernel%) in mentions of
        /proc/sys/ostype, /proc/sys/osrelease and proc/sys/version.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed things to correct and to clarify in subsection
        "/proc/filesystems" of proc.5:
        - clarify filesystems listing: not only FS compiled
          into the kernel, also FS kernel modules currently loaded
        - add a reference to fs(5)
        - add an explanation for FS marked with "nodev"
        - s/mount(1)/mount(8)/, also corrected in section "SEE ALSO"
        - clarify usage by mount: the current wording may lead to
          think /proc/filesystems is always used by mount when no FS
          is specified. So, usage of "may" which IMHO is more
          appropriate + additional explanations
          In mount(8) we can see:

               If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is
               specified, mount will try to guess the desired type.
               If mount was compiled with the blkid library, the
               guessing is done by this library. Otherwise, mount
               guesses itself by probing the superblock; if that
               does not turn up anything that looks familiar,
               mount will try to read the file /etc/filesystems,
               or, if that does not exist, /proc/filesystems.
               All of the filesystem types listed there will be
               tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev"
               (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs). If /etc/filesystems
               ends in a line with a single * only, mount will
               read /proc/filesystems afterwards.
    Samuel Thibault
        Since linux 2.6.11, /proc/stat has an eighth value for cpu
        lines: stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating
        systems when running in a virtualized environment.

arp.7
        Updated BUGS text referring to jiffies; refer to time.7 instead.

credentials.7
    mtk
        Add words to note that file system ID is Linux specific.

hier.7
    Maxime Vaudequin
        This is some corrections for hier.7:
        - missing period for /media and /mnt
        - /mnt description is not totally correct, it is true for some
          distributions but in others /mnt is used as a temporary FS
          mount point, as it is specified by FHS:
          http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#
                      MNTMOUNTPOINTFORATEMPORARILYMOUNT
        - s/X-Windows/X-Window/ (3 occurrences)
        - section "SEE ALSO": s/mount(1)/mount(8)/

man-pages.7
man.7
mdoc.7
mdoc.samples.7
    mtk / Nicolas Franois
        Nowadays tmac.XXX are called XXX.tmac.

pthreads.7
    mtk
        Update text about modern threading implementations
        (NPTL vs LinuxThreads).

socket.7
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen
        Clarify that SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO only have effect for
        socket I/O calls; not for multiplexing system calls like
        select() and poll().

time.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO reference to new timeradd.3.

Global changes

*.1p
*.3p
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen and consultation with Andrew Josey.
        Add a PROLOG section:
            This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
            The Linux implementation of this interface may differ
            (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details
            of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented
            on Linux.

*.0p
*.1p
*.3p
    mtk
        Some formatting fixes, mostly to get rid of unwanted
        spaces before "," in formatted output.

*
*/*
    mtk
        Change all occurrences of my email address in man-pages source
	to my new gmail address.

Many many pages
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed useless use of macros with alternating formatting
        (".IR" instead ".I" which suffices, ".BR" instead ".B", etc.)
        because there is only one element.  For example in ldconfig.8:

            -.BR /sbin/ldconfig
            +.B /sbin/ldconfig

        This is not very important, it only makes the sources more tidy.
        To find these I used:

            egrep '^\.(B[RI]|R[IB]|I[RB]) ([^ ]+|\"[^\"]\+\")$'

        And if you want to make these changes, you can use:

            sed 's/^\(\.[BRI]\)[BRI]\( \([^ ]\+\|\"[^\"]\+\"\)\)$/\1\2/g'
