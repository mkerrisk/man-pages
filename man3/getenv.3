.SH NAME
getenv \- get an environment variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "char *getenv(const char *" name );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR getenv ()
function searches the environment list to find the
environment variable
.IR name ,
and returns a pointer to the corresponding
.I value
string.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR getenv ()
function returns a pointer to the value in the
environment, or NULL if there is no match.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.
.SH NOTES
The strings in the environment list are of the form \fIname=value\fP.

As typically implemented,
.BR getenv ()
returns a pointer to a string within the environment list.
The caller must take care not to modify this string,
since that would change the environment of the process.

The implementation of
.BR getenv ()
is not required to be reentrant.
The string pointed to by the return value of
.BR getenv ()
may be statically allocated,
and can be modified by a subsequent call to
.BR getenv (),
.BR putenv (3),
.BR setenv (3),
or
.BR unsetenv (3).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR clearenv (3),
.BR putenv (3),
.BR setenv (3),
.BR unsetenv (3),
.BR environ (7)
