.TH SETGID 2 2010-11-22 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
setgid \- set group identity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int setgid(gid_t " gid );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR setgid ()
sets the effective group ID of the calling process.
If the caller is the
superuser, the real GID and saved set-group-ID are also set.

Under Linux,
.BR setgid ()
is implemented like the POSIX version with the
.B _POSIX_SAVED_IDS
feature.
This allows a set-group-ID program that is not set-user-ID-root
to drop all of its group
privileges, do some un-privileged work, and then reengage the original
effective group ID in a secure manner.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EPERM
The calling process is not privileged (does not have the
\fBCAP_SETGID\fP capability), and
.I gid
does not match the real group ID or saved set-group-ID of
the calling process.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
The original Linux
.BR setgid ()
system call supported only 16-bit group IDs.
Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added
.BR setgid32 ()
supporting 32-bit IDs.
The glibc
.BR setgid ()
wrapper function transparently deals with the variation across kernel versions.
