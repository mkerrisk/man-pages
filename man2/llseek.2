.sp
.B #include <linux/unistd.h>
.sp
.B _syscall5(int, _llseek, uint, fd, ulong, hi, ulong, lo, loff_t *, res, uint, wh);
.sp
.BI "int _llseek(unsigned int " fd ", unsigned long " offset_high ,
.BI "unsigned long " offset_low ", loff_t *" result ", unsigned int " whence );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _llseek
function repositions the offset of the file descriptor
.I fd
to
.I (offset_high<<32) | offset_low
bytes relative to the beginning of the file, the current position in the file,
or the end of the file, depending on whether
.I  whence
is
.BR SEEK_SET ,
.BR SEEK_CUR ,
or
.BR SEEK_END ,
respectively.
It returns the resulting file position in the argument
.IR result .

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
.B _llseek
returns 0. Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF

is not an open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EFAULT
Problem with copying results to user space.
