.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <strings.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR strcasecmp ()
function compares the two strings \fIs1\fP and
\fIs2\fP, ignoring the case of the characters.
It returns an integer
less than, equal to, or greater than zero if \fIs1\fP is found,
respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than \fIs2\fP.
.PP
The
.BR strncasecmp ()
function is similar, except it only compares
the first \fIn\fP bytes of \fIs1\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR strcasecmp ()
and
.BR strncasecmp ()
functions return
an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if \fIs1\fP
(or the first \fIn\fP bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be
less than, to match, or be greater than \fIs2\fP.
