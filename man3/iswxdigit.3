.TH ISWXDIGIT 3  1999-07-25 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswxdigit \- test for hexadecimal digit wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswxdigit(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBiswxdigit\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBisxdigit\fP function. It tests whether \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide character class "xdigit".
.PP
The wide character class "xdigit" is a subclass of the wide character class
"alnum", and therefore also a subclass of the wide character class "graph" and
of the wide character class "print".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide character class "print", the wide character class
"xdigit" is disjoint from the wide character class "cntrl".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide character class "graph", the wide character class
"xdigit" is disjoint from the wide character class "space" and its subclass
"blank".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide character class "alnum", the wide character class
"xdigit" is disjoint from the wide character class "punct".
.PP
The wide character class "xdigit" always contains at least the letters 'A'
to 'F', 'a' to 'f' and the digits '0' to '9'.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBiswxdigit\fP function returns non-zero if \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide character class "xdigit". Otherwise it returns zero.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO/ANSI C, UNIX98
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR iswctype (3),
.BR isxdigit (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBiswxdigit\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
