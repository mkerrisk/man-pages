.TH SHMGET 2 2012-05-31 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
shmget \- allocates a shared memory segment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ad l
.B #include <sys/ipc.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/shm.h>
.sp
.BI "int shmget(key_t " key ", size_t " size ", int " shmflg );
.ad b
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR shmget ()
returns the identifier of the shared memory segment
associated with the value of the argument
.IR key .
A new shared memory segment, with size equal to the value of
.I size
rounded up to a multiple of
.BR PAGE_SIZE ,
is created if
.I key
has the value
.B IPC_PRIVATE
or
.I key
isn't
.BR IPC_PRIVATE ,
no shared memory segment corresponding to
.I key
exists, and
.B IPC_CREAT
is specified in
.IR shmflg .
.PP
If
.I shmflg
specifies both
.B IPC_CREAT
and
.B IPC_EXCL
and a shared memory segment already exists for
.IR key ,
then
.BR shmget ()
fails with
.I errno
set to
.BR EEXIST .
(This is analogous to the effect of the combination
.B O_CREAT | O_EXCL
for
.BR open (2).)
.PP
The value
.I shmflg
is composed of:
.TP 12
.B IPC_CREAT
to create a new segment.
If this flag is not used, then
.BR shmget ()
will find the segment associated with \fIkey\fP and check to see if
the user has permission to access the segment.
.TP
.B IPC_EXCL
used with \fBIPC_CREAT\fP to ensure failure if the segment already exists.
.TP
.I mode_flags
(least significant 9 bits)
specifying the permissions granted to the owner, group, and world.
These bits have the same format, and the same
meaning, as the
.I mode
argument of
.BR open (2).
Presently, the execute permissions are not used by the system.
.TP
.BR SHM_HUGETLB " (since Linux 2.6)"
Allocate the segment using "huge pages."
See the Linux kernel source file
.I Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
for further information.
.TP
.BR SHM_NORESERVE " (since Linux 2.6.15)"
This flag serves the same purpose as the
.BR mmap (2)
.B MAP_NORESERVE
flag.
Do not reserve swap space for this segment.
When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee
that it is possible to modify the segment.
When swap space is not reserved one might get
.B SIGSEGV
upon a write
if no physical memory is available.
See also the discussion of the file
.I /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
in
.BR proc (5).
.\" As at 2.6.17-rc2, this flag has no effect if SHM_HUGETLB was also
.\" specified.
.PP
When a new shared memory segment is created,
its contents are initialized to zero values, and
its associated data structure,
.I shmid_ds
(see
.BR shmctl (2)),
is initialized as follows:
.IP
.I shm_perm.cuid
and
.I shm_perm.uid
are set to the effective user ID of the calling process.
.IP
.I shm_perm.cgid
and
.I shm_perm.gid
are set to the effective group ID of the calling process.
.IP
The least significant 9 bits of
.I shm_perm.mode
are set to the least significant 9 bit of
.IR shmflg .
.IP
.I shm_segsz
is set to the value of
.IR size .
.IP
.IR shm_lpid ,
.IR shm_nattch ,
.I shm_atime
and
.I shm_dtime
are set to 0.
.IP
.I shm_ctime
is set to the current time.
.PP
If the shared memory segment already exists, the permissions are
verified, and a check is made to see if it is marked for destruction.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A valid segment identifier,
.IR shmid ,
is returned on success, \-1 on error.
.SH ERRORS
On failure,
.I errno
is set to one of the following:
.TP
.B EACCES
The user does not have permission to access the
shared memory segment, and does not have the
.B CAP_IPC_OWNER
capability.
.TP
.B EEXIST
.B IPC_CREAT | IPC_EXCL
was specified and the segment exists.
.TP
.B EINVAL
A new segment was to be created and \fIsize\fP < \fBSHMMIN\fP
or \fIsize\fP > \fBSHMMAX\fP, or no new segment was to be created,
a segment with given key existed, but \fIsize\fP is greater than the size
of that segment.
.TP
.B ENFILE
.\" [2.6.7] shmem_zero_setup()-->shmem_file_setup()-->get_empty_filp()
The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
.TP
.B ENOENT
No segment exists for the given \fIkey\fP, and
.B IPC_CREAT
was not specified.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
No memory could be allocated for segment overhead.
.TP
.B ENOSPC
All possible shared memory IDs have been taken
.RB ( SHMMNI ),
or allocating a segment of the requested
.I size
would cause the system to exceed the system-wide limit on shared memory
.RB ( SHMALL ).
.TP
.B EPERM
The
.B SHM_HUGETLB
flag was specified, but the caller was not privileged (did not have the
.B CAP_IPC_LOCK
capability).
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.
.\" SVr4 documents an additional error condition EEXIST.

.B SHM_HUGETLB
is a nonportable Linux extension.
.SH NOTES
The inclusion of
.I <sys/types.h>
and
.I <sys/ipc.h>
isn't required on Linux or by any version of POSIX.
However,
some old implementations required the inclusion of these header files,
and the SVID also documented their inclusion.
Applications intended to be portable to such old systems may need
to include these header files.
.\" Like Linux, the FreeBSD man pages still document
.\" the inclusion of these header files.

.B IPC_PRIVATE
isn't a flag field but a
.I key_t
type.
If this special value is used for
.IR key ,
the system call ignores everything but the least significant 9 bits of
.I shmflg
and creates a new shared memory segment (on success).
.PP
The following limits on shared memory segment resources affect the
.BR shmget ()
call:
.TP
.B SHMALL
System wide maximum of shared memory pages
(on Linux, this limit can be read and modified via
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/shmall ).
.TP
.B SHMMAX
Maximum size in bytes for a shared memory segment: policy dependent
(on Linux, this limit can be read and modified via
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax ).
.TP
.B SHMMIN
Minimum size in bytes for a shared memory segment: implementation
dependent (currently 1 byte, though
.B PAGE_SIZE
is the effective minimum size).
.TP
.B SHMMNI
System wide maximum number of shared memory segments: implementation
dependent (currently 4096, was 128 before Linux 2.3.99;
on Linux, this limit can be read and modified via
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni ).
.\" Kernels between 2.4.x and 2.6.8 had an off-by-one error that meant
.\" that we could create one more segment than SHMMNI -- MTK
.\" This /proc file is not available in Linux 2.2 and earlier -- MTK
.PP
The implementation has no specific limits for the per-process maximum
number of shared memory segments
.RB ( SHMSEG ).
.SS Linux notes
Until version 2.3.30 Linux would return
.B EIDRM
for a
.BR shmget ()
on a shared memory segment scheduled for deletion.
.SH BUGS
The name choice
.B IPC_PRIVATE
was perhaps unfortunate,
.B IPC_NEW
would more clearly show its function.
