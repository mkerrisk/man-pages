.TH PIDFD_SEND_SIGNAL 2 2021-03-22 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
pidfd_send_signal \- send a signal to a process specified by a file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#include <linux/signal.h>" "     /* Definition of " SIG* " constants */"
.BR "#include <signal.h>" "           /* Definition of " SI_* " constants */"
.BR "#include <sys/syscall.h>" "      /* Definition of " SYS_* " constants */"
.B #include <unistd.h>
.PP
.BI "int syscall(SYS_pidfd_send_signal, int " pidfd ", int " sig \
", siginfo_t *" info ,
.BI "                      unsigned int " flags );
.fi
.PP
.IR Note :
glibc provides no wrapper for
.BR pidfd_send_signal (),
necessitating the use of
.BR syscall (2).
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pidfd_send_signal ()
system call sends the signal
.I sig
to the target process referred to by
.IR pidfd ,
a PID file descriptor that refers to a process.
.\" See the very detailed commit message for kernel commit
.\" 3eb39f47934f9d5a3027fe00d906a45fe3a15fad
.PP
If the
.I info
argument points to a
.I siginfo_t
buffer, that buffer should be populated as described in
.BR rt_sigqueueinfo (2).
.PP
If the
.I info
argument is a NULL pointer,
this is equivalent to specifying a pointer to a
.I siginfo_t
buffer whose fields match the values that are
implicitly supplied when a signal is sent using
.BR kill (2):
.PP
.PD 0
.IP * 3
.I si_signo
is set to the signal number;
.IP *
.I si_errno
is set to 0;
.IP *
.I si_code
is set to
.BR SI_USER ;
.IP *
.I si_pid
is set to the caller's PID; and
.IP *
.I si_uid
is set to the caller's real user ID.
.PD
.PP
The calling process must either be in the same PID namespace as the
process referred to by
.IR pidfd ,
or be in an ancestor of that namespace.
.PP
The
.I flags
argument is reserved for future use;
currently, this argument must be specified as 0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR pidfd_send_signal ()
returns 0.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I pidfd
is not a valid PID file descriptor.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I sig
is not a valid signal.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The calling process is not in a PID namespace from which it can
send a signal to the target process.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I flags
is not 0.
.TP
.B EPERM
The calling process does not have permission to send the signal
to the target process.
.TP
.B EPERM
.I pidfd
doesn't refer to the calling process, and
.IR info.si_code
is invalid (see
.BR rt_sigqueueinfo (2)).
.TP
.B ESRCH
The target process does not exist
(i.e., it has terminated and been waited on).
.SH VERSIONS
.BR pidfd_send_signal ()
first appeared in Linux 5.1.
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR pidfd_send_signal ()
is Linux specific.
.SH NOTES
.SS PID file descriptors
The
.I pidfd
argument is a PID file descriptor,
a file descriptor that refers to  process.
Such a file descriptor can be obtained in any of the following ways:
.IP * 3
by opening a
.IR /proc/[pid]
directory;
.IP *
using
.BR pidfd_open (2);
or
.IP *
via the PID file descriptor that is returned by a call to
.BR clone (2)
or
.BR clone3 (2)
that specifies the
.BR CLONE_PIDFD
flag.
.PP
The
.BR pidfd_send_signal ()
system call allows the avoidance of race conditions that occur
when using traditional interfaces (such as
.BR kill (2))
to signal a process.
The problem is that the traditional interfaces specify the target process
via a process ID (PID),
with the result that the sender may accidentally send a signal to
the wrong process if the originally intended target process
has terminated and its PID has been recycled for another process.
By contrast,
a PID file descriptor is a stable reference to a specific process;
if that process terminates,
.BR pidfd_send_signal ()
fails with the error
.BR ESRCH .
