.SH NAME
wcsncmp \- compare two fixed-size wide-character strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "int wcsncmp(const wchar_t *" s1 ", const wchar_t *" s2 ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR wcsncmp ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR strncmp (3)
function.
It compares the wide-character string pointed to by \fIs1\fP and the
wide-character string pointed to by \fIs2\fP, but at most \fIn\fP wide
characters from each string.
In each string, the comparison extends only up
to the first occurrence of a null wide character (L\(aq\\0\(aq), if any.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR wcsncmp ()
function returns zero if the wide-character strings at
\fIs1\fP and \fIs2\fP, truncated to at most length \fIn\fP, are equal.
It returns an integer greater than zero if at the first differing position
\fIi\fP (\fIi\fP < \fIn\fP),
the corresponding wide-character \fIs1[i]\fP is
greater than \fIs2[i]\fP.
It returns an integer less than zero if at the first
differing position \fIi\fP (\fIi\fP < \fIn\fP), the corresponding
wide-character \fIs1[i]\fP is less than \fIs2[i]\fP.
