.TH MSYNC 2 2003-08-21 "Linux 2.4" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
msync \- synchronize a file with a memory map
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/mman.h>
.sp
.BI "int msync(void *" start ", size_t " length ", int " flags );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B msync
flushes changes made to the in-core copy of a file that was mapped
into memory using
.BR mmap (2)
back to disk.  Without use of this call
there is no guarantee that changes are written back before
.BR munmap (2)
is called.  To be more precise, the part of the file that
corresponds to the memory area starting at
.I start
and having length
.I length
is updated.  The
.I flags
argument may have the bits MS_ASYNC, MS_SYNC and MS_INVALIDATE set,
but not both MS_ASYNC and MS_SYNC.
MS_ASYNC specifies that an update be scheduled, but the call
returns immediately.
MS_SYNC asks for an update and waits for it to complete.
MS_INVALIDATE asks to invalidate other mappings of the same file
(so that they can be updated with the fresh values just written).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.BR EINVAL
.I start
is not a multiple of PAGESIZE, or any bit other than
MS_ASYNC | MS_INVALIDATE | MS_SYNC is set in
.IR flags.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
The indicated memory (or part of it) was not mapped.
.SH AVAILABILITY
On POSIX systems on which
.B msync
is available, both
.B _POSIX_MAPPED_FILES
and
.B _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO
are defined in <unistd.h> to a value greater than 0. (See also
.BR sysconf (3).)
.\" POSIX 1003.1-2001: It shall be defined to -1 or 0 or 200112L.
.\" -1: unavailable, 0: ask using sysconf().
.\" glibc defines them to 1.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX.1b (formerly POSIX.4)

This call was introduced in Linux 1.3.21, and then used EFAULT instead of
ENOMEM. In Linux 2.4.19 this was changed to the POSIX value ENOMEM.
