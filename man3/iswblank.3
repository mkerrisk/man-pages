.TH ISWBLANK 3  1999-07-25 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswblank \- test for whitespace wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswblank(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBiswblank\fP function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fBisblank\fP function. It tests whether \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide character class "blank".
.PP
The wide character class "blank" is a subclass of the wide character class
"space".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide character class "space", the wide character class
"blank" is disjoint from the wide character class "graph" and therefore also
disjoint from its subclasses "alnum", "alpha", "upper", "lower", "digit",
"xdigit", "punct".
.PP
The wide character class "blank" always contains at least the space character
and the control character '\\t'.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBiswblank\fP function returns non-zero if \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide character class "blank". Otherwise it returns zero.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is a GNU extension.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR isblank (3),
.BR iswctype (3)
.SH NOTES
The behaviour of \fBiswblank\fP depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
current locale.
