.TH PTHREAD_KILL 3 2009-01-28 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
pthread_kill \- send a signal to a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <signal.h>

.BI "int pthread_kill(pthread_t " thread ", int " sig );
.fi
.sp
Compile and link with \fI\-pthread\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_kill ()
function sends the signal
.I sig
to
.IR thread ,
another thread in the same process as the caller.
The signal is asynchronously directed to
.IR thread .

If
.I sig
is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still performed;
this can be used to check for the existence of a thread ID.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR pthread_kill ()
returns 0;
on error, it returns an error number, and no signal is sent.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
An invalid signal was specified.
.TP
.B ESRCH
No thread with the ID
.I thread
could be found.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
Signal dispositions are process-wide:
if a signal handler is installed,
the handler will be invoked in the thread
.IR thread ,
but if the disposition of the signal is "stop", "continue", or "terminate",
this action will affect the whole process.
