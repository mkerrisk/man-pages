.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR stpcpy ()
function copies the string pointed to by \fIsrc\fP
(including the terminating null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq)) to the array pointed to by
\fIdest\fP.
The strings may not overlap, and the destination string
\fIdest\fP must be large enough to receive the copy.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR stpcpy ()
returns a pointer to the \fBend\fP of the string
\fIdest\fP (that is, the address of the terminating null byte)
rather than the beginning.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function was added to POSIX.1-2008. Before that, it was not part of
the C or POSIX.1 standards, nor customary on UNIX systems, but was not a
GNU invention either. Perhaps it came from MS-DOS. It is also present on
the BSDs.
.SH EXAMPLE
For example, this program uses
.BR stpcpy ()
to concatenate \fBfoo\fP and
\fBbar\fP to produce \fBfoobar\fP, which it then prints.
