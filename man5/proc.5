.TH PROC 5 2008-11-20 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
proc \- process information pseudo-file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I proc
file system is a pseudo-file system which is used as an interface to
kernel data structures.
It is commonly mounted at
.IR /proc .
Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be
changed.
.LP
The following outline gives a quick tour through the
.I /proc
hierarchy.
.PD 1
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]
There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the
subdirectory is named by the process ID.
Each such subdirectory contains the following
pseudo-files and directories.
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/attr and
.\"       /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/attr
.\"	  This is a directory
.\"       Added in ???
.\"	  CONFIG_SECURITY
.\"
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/auxv " (since 2.6.0-test7)"
This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter information passed
to the process at exec time.
The format is one \fIunsigned long\fP ID
plus one \fIunsigned long\fP value for each entry.
The last entry contains two zeros.
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/cgroup and
.\"       /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/cgroup
.\" 	  Info in Documentation/cgroups.txt
.\"       Added in 2.6.24
.\"	  CONFIG_CGROUPS
.\"
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/clear_refs
.\"       Added in 2.6.22
.\"       "Clears page referenced bits shown in smaps output"
.\"       write-only
.\"       CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/cmdline
This holds the complete command line for the process,
unless the process is a zombie.
.\" In 2.3.26, this also used to be true if the process was swapped out.
In the latter case, there is nothing in this file:
that is, a read on this file will return 0 characters.
The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of
null-separated strings,
with a further null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq) after the last string.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/coredump_filter " (since kernel 2.6.23)"
See
.BR core (5).
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/cpuset " (since kernel 2.6.12)"
.\" and/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/cpuset
See
.BR cpuset (7).
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/cwd
This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.
To find out the current working directory of process 20,
for instance, you can do this:

.in +4n
.nf
.RB "$" " cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd"
.fi
.in

Note that the
.I pwd
command is often a shell built-in, and might
not work properly.
In
.BR bash (1),
you may use
.IR "pwd\ \-P" .

.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/environ
This file contains the environment for the process.
The entries are separated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
and there may be a null byte at the end.
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:
.in +4n
.nf

.ft CW
.RB "$" " (cat /proc/1/environ; echo) | tr \(aq\e000\(aq \(aq\en\(aq"
.fi
.ft P
.in
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link
containing the actual pathname of the executed command.
This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open
it will open the executable.
You can even type
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
to run another copy of the same executable as is being run by
process [pid].
.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).

Under Linux 2.0 and earlier
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
is a pointer to the binary which was executed,
and appears as a symbolic link.
A
.BR readlink (2)
call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a string in the format:

    [device]:inode

For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE,
MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition on the first drive).

.BR find (1)
with the
.I \-inum
option can be used to locate the file.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/fd
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a
symbolic link to the actual file.
Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, etc.

.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).

Programs that will take a filename as a command-line argument,
but will not take input from standard input if no argument is supplied,
or that write to a file named as a command-line argument,
but will not send their output to standard output
if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless be made to use
standard input or standard out using
.IR /proc/[pid]/fd .
For example, assuming that
.I \-i
is the flag designating an input file and
.I \-o
is the flag designating an output file:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " foobar \-i /proc/self/fd/0 \-o /proc/self/fd/1 ..."
.fi
.in

and you have a working filter.
.\" The following is not true in my tests (MTK):
.\" Note that this will not work for
.\" programs that seek on their files, as the files in the fd directory
.\" are not seekable.

.I /proc/self/fd/N
is approximately the same as
.I /dev/fd/N
in some Unix and Unix-like systems.
Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link
.I /dev/fd
to
.IR /proc/self/fd ,
in fact.

Most systems provide symbolic links
.IR /dev/stdin ,
.IR /dev/stdout ,
and
.IR /dev/stderr ,
which respectively link to the files
.IR 0 ,
.IR 1 ,
and
.IR 2
in
.IR /proc/self/fd .
Thus the example command above could be written as:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " foobar \-i /dev/stdin \-o /dev/stdout ..."
.fi
.in
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/loginuid
.\"       Added in 2.6.11; updating requires CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL
.\"       CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/fdinfo/ " (since kernel 2.6.22)"
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor.
The contents of each file can be read to obtain information
about the corresponding file descriptor, for example:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4"
pos:    1000
flags:  01002002
.fi
.in

The
.I pos
field is a decimal number showing the current file offset.
The
.I flags
field is an octal number that displays the
file access mode and file status flags (see
.BR open (2)).

The files in this directory are readable only by the owner of the process.
.\" FIXME document /proc/[pid]/io
.\" .TP
.\" .IR /proc/[pid]/io " (since kernel 2.6.20)"
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/limits " (since kernel 2.6.24)"
This file displays the soft limit, hard limit, and units of measurement
for each of the process's resource limits (see
.BR getrlimit (2)).
The file is protected to only allow reading by the real UID of the process.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/maps
A file containing the currently mapped memory regions and their access
permissions.

The format is:

.nf
.ft CW
address           perms offset  dev   inode   pathname
08048000-08056000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 64593   /usr/sbin/gpm

bffff000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
.ft
.fi

where "address" is the address space in the process that it occupies,
"perms" is a set of permissions:

.nf
.in +5
r = read
w = write
x = execute
s = shared
p = private (copy on write)
.fi
.in

"offset" is the offset into the file/whatever, "dev" is the device
(major:minor), and "inode" is the inode on that device.
0 indicates that no inode is associated with the memory region,
as the case would be with BSS (uninitialized data).

Under Linux 2.0 there is no field giving pathname.
.TP

(*) X is the closest dominant peer group under the process's root.
If X is the immediate master of the mount,
or if there is no dominant peer group under the same root,
then only the "master:X" field is present
and not the "propagate_from:X" field.

.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/mounts " (since Linux 2.4.19)"
This is a list of all the file systems currently mounted in the
process's mount namespace.
The format of this file is documented in
.BR fstab (5).
Since kernel version 2.6.15, this file is pollable:
after opening the file for reading, a change in this file
(i.e., a file system mount or unmount) causes

.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_adj " (since Linux 2.6.11)"
This file can be used to adjust the score used to select which process
should be killed in an out-of-memory (OOM) situation.
The kernel uses this value for a bit-shift operation of the process's
.IR oom_score
value:
valid values are in the range \-16 to +15,
plus the special value \-17,
which disables OOM-killing altogether for this process.
A positive score increases the likelihood of this
process being killed by the OOM-killer;
a negative score decreases the likelihood.
The default value for this file is 0;
a new process inherits its parent's

\fIpriority\fP %ld
(Explanation for Linux 2.6)
For processes running a real-time scheduling policy
.RI ( policy
below; see
.BR sched_setscheduler (2)),
this is the negated scheduling priority, minus one;
that is, a number in the range \-2 to \-100,
corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99.
For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy,
this is the raw nice value
.RB ( setpriority (2))
as represented in the kernel.
The kernel stores nice values as numbers
in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low),

.IR /proc/[pid]/task " (since Linux 2.6.0-test6)"
This is a directory that contains one subdirectory
for each thread in the process.
The name of each subdirectory is the numerical thread ID
.RI ( [tid] )
of the thread (see
.BR gettid (2)).
Within each of these subdirectories, there is a set of
files with the same names and contents as under the
.I /proc/[pid]
directories.
For attributes that are shared by all threads, the contents for
each of the files under the
.I task/[tid]
subdirectories will be the same as in the corresponding
file in the parent
.I /proc/[pid]
directory
(e.g., in a multithreaded process, all of the
.I task/[tid]/cwd
files will have the same value as the
.I /proc/[pid]/cwd
file in the parent directory, since all of the threads in a process
share a working directory).
For attributes that are distinct for each thread,
the corresponding files under
.I task/[tid]
may have different values (e.g., various fields in each of the
.I task/[tid]/status
files may be different for each thread).

.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
.I /proc/[pid]/task
directory are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).
.TP
.I /proc/apm
Advanced power management version and battery information when
.B CONFIG_APM
is defined at kernel compilation time.
.TP
.I /proc/bus

.TP
.I /proc/bus/pccard/drivers
.TP
.I /proc/bus/pci
Contains various bus subdirectories and pseudo-files containing
information about PCI busses, installed devices, and device
drivers.
Some of these files are not ASCII.
.TP
.I /proc/bus/pci/devices
Information about PCI devices.
They may be accessed through
.BR lspci (8)
and
.BR setpci (8).
.TP
.I /proc/cmdline
Arguments passed to the Linux kernel at boot time.
Often done via a boot manager such as
.BR lilo (8)
or
.BR grub (8).
.TP
.IR /proc/config.gz " (since Linux 2.6)"
This file exposes the configuration options that were used
to build the currently running kernel,
in the same format as they would be shown in the
.I .config
file that resulted when configuring the kernel (using
.IR "make xconfig" ,
.IR "make config" ,
or similar).
The file contents are compressed; view or search them using
.BR zcat (1),
.BR zgrep (1),
etc.
As long as no changes have been made to the following file,
the contents of
.I /proc/config.gz
are the same as those provided by :
.in +4n
.nf

cat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/.config
.fi
.in

.BR CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC .
.TP
.I /proc/cpuinfo
This is a collection of CPU and system architecture dependent items,
for each supported architecture a different list.
Two common entries are \fIprocessor\fP which gives CPU number and
\fIbogomips\fP; a system constant that is calculated
during kernel initialization.
SMP machines have information for
each CPU.
.TP
.I /proc/devices
Text listing of major numbers and device groups.
This can be used by MAKEDEV scripts for consistency with the kernel.
.TP
.IR /proc/diskstats " (since Linux 2.5.69)"

See the kernel source file
.I Documentation/iostats.txt
for further information.
.TP
.I /proc/dma
This is a list of the registered \fIISA\fP DMA (direct memory access)
channels in use.
.TP
.I /proc/driver
Empty subdirectory.
.TP
.I /proc/execdomains
List of the execution domains (ABI personalities).
.TP
.I /proc/fb
Frame buffer information when
.B CONFIG_FB
is defined during kernel compilation.
.TP
.I /proc/filesystems
A text listing of the file systems which are supported by the kernel,
namely file systems which were compiled into the kernel or whose kernel
modules are currently loaded.
(See also
.BR filesystems (5).)
If a file system is marked with "nodev",
this means that it does not require a block device to be mounted
(e.g., virtual file system, network file system).

Incidentally, this file may be used by
.BR mount (8)
when no file system is specified and it didn't manage to determine the
file system type.
Then file systems contained in this file are tried
(excepted those that are marked with "nodev").
.TP
.I /proc/fs
Empty subdirectory.
.TP
.I /proc/ide
This directory
exists on systems with the IDE bus.
There are directories for each IDE channel and attached device.

The
.BR hdparm (8)
utility provides access to this information in a friendly format.
.TP
.I /proc/interrupts
This is used to record the number of interrupts per CPU per IO device.
Since Linux 2.6.24,
for the i386 and x86_64 architectures, at least, this also includes
interrupts internal to the system (that is, not associated with a device
as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable interrupt), LOC (local timer interrupt),
and for SMP systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and possibly others.
Very easy to read formatting, done in ASCII.
.TP
.I /proc/iomem
I/O memory map in Linux 2.4.
.TP
.I /proc/ioports
This is a list of currently registered Input-Output port regions that
are in use.
.TP
.IR /proc/kallsyms " (since Linux 2.5.71)"
This holds the kernel exported symbol definitions used by the
.BR modules (X)
tools to dynamically link and bind loadable modules.
In Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly different syntax
was named
.IR ksyms .
.TP
.I /proc/kcore
This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored
in the ELF core file format.
With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped
kernel
.RI ( /usr/src/linux/vmlinux )
binary, GDB can be used to
examine the current state of any kernel data structures.

The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus
4KB.
.TP
.I /proc/kmsg
This file can be used instead of the
.BR syslog (2)
system call to read kernel messages.
A process must have superuser
privileges to read this file, and only one process should read this
file.
This file should not be read if a syslog process is running
which uses the
.BR syslog (2)
system call facility to log kernel messages.

Information in this file is retrieved with the
.BR dmesg (8)
program.
.TP
.IR /proc/ksyms " (Linux 1.1.23-2.5.47)"
See
.IR /proc/kallsyms .
.TP
.I /proc/loadavg
The first three fields in this file are load average figures
giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R)
or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
They are the same as the load average numbers given by
.BR uptime (1)
and other programs.
The fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).
The first of these is the number of currently executing kernel
scheduling entities (processes, threads);
this will be less than or equal to the number of CPUs.
The value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities
that currently exist on the system.
The fifth field is the PID of the process that was most
recently created on the system.
.TP
.I /proc/locks
This file shows current file locks
.RB ( flock "(2) and " fcntl (2))
and leases
.RB ( fcntl (2)).
.TP
.IR /proc/malloc " (only up to and including Linux 2.2)"
.\" It looks like this only ever did something back in 1.0 days
This file is only present if
.B CONFIG_DEBUG_MALLOC
was defined during compilation.
.TP
.I /proc/meminfo
This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system.
It is used by
.BR free (1)
to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap)
on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the
kernel.
.TP
.I /proc/mounts
Before kernel 2.4.19, this file was a list
of all the file systems currently mounted on the system.
With the introduction of per-process mount namespaces in
Linux 2.4.19, this file became a link to
.IR /proc/self/mounts ,
which lists the mount points of the process's own mount namespace.
The format of this file is documented in
.BR fstab (5).
.TP
.I /proc/modules
A text list of the modules that have been loaded by the system.
See also
.BR lsmod (8).
.TP
.I /proc/mtrr
Memory Type Range Registers.
See the kernel source file
.I Documentation/mtrr.txt
for details.
.TP
.I /proc/net
various net pseudo-files, all of which give the status of some part of
the networking layer.
These files contain ASCII structures and are,
therefore, readable with
.BR cat (1).
However, the standard
.BR netstat (8)
suite provides much cleaner access to these files.
.TP
.I /proc/net/arp
This holds an ASCII readable dump of the kernel ARP table used for
address resolutions.
It will show both dynamically learned and pre-programmed ARP entries.
The format is:

.nf
.ft CW
.in 8n
IP address     HW type   Flags     HW address          Mask   Device
192.168.0.50   0x1       0x2       00:50:BF:25:68:F3   *      eth0
192.168.0.250  0x1       0xc       00:00:00:00:00:00   *      eth0
.ft
.fi
.in

Here "IP address" is the IPv4 address of the machine and the "HW type"
is the hardware type of the address from RFC\ 826.
The flags are the internal
flags of the ARP structure (as defined in
.IR /usr/include/linux/if_arp.h )
and
the "HW address" is the data link layer mapping for that IP address if
it is known.
.TP
.I /proc/net/dev
The dev pseudo-file contains network device status information.
This gives
the number of received and sent packets, the number of errors and
collisions
and other basic statistics.
These are used by the
.BR ifconfig (8)
program to report device status.
The format is:

.nf
.ft CW

\&"St" is the internal status of the socket.
The "tx_queue" and "rx_queue" are the
outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.
The "tr", "tm\->when", and "rexmits" fields hold internal information of
the kernel socket state and are only useful for debugging.

.I /proc/scsi
A directory with the
.I scsi
mid-level pseudo-file and various SCSI low-level
driver directories,
which contain a file for each SCSI host in this system, all of
which give the status of some part of the SCSI IO subsystem.
These files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore, readable with
.BR cat (1).

You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure the subsystem or
switch certain features on or off.
.TP
.I /proc/scsi/scsi
This is a listing of all SCSI devices known to the kernel.
The listing is similar to the one seen during bootup.
scsi currently supports only the \fIadd-single-device\fP command which
allows root to add a hotplugged device to the list of known devices.

The command
.in +4n
.nf

echo \(aqscsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0\(aq > /proc/scsi/scsi

.fi
.in
will cause
host scsi1 to scan on SCSI channel 0 for a device on ID 5 LUN 0.
If there

scsi_debug, seagate, t128, u15-24f, ultrastore, or wd7000.
These directories show up for all drivers that registered at least one
SCSI HBA.
Every directory contains one file per registered host.
Every host-file is named after the number the host was assigned during
initialization.

Reading these files will usually show driver and host configuration,
statistics, etc.

Writing to these files allows different things on different hosts.
For example, with the \fIlatency\fP and \fInolatency\fP commands,
root can switch on and off command latency measurement code in the
eata_dma driver.
With the \fIlockup\fP and \fIunlock\fP commands,
root can control bus lockups simulated by the scsi_debug driver.

.I /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
This (read-only) file gives the number of files presently opened.
It contains three numbers: the number of allocated file handles;
the number of free file handles; and the maximum number of file handles.
The kernel allocates file handles dynamically, but it
doesn't free them again.
If the number of allocated files is close to the
maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum.
When the number of free file handles is
large, you've encountered a peak in your usage of file
handles and you probably don't need to increase the maximum.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/fs/inode-max
This file contains the maximum number of in-memory inodes.
On some (2.4) systems, it may not be present.
This value should be 3-4 times larger
than the value in
.IR file-max ,
since \fIstdin\fP, \fIstdout\fP

.I nr_inodes
is the number of inodes the system has allocated.
This can be slightly more than
.I inode-max
because Linux allocates them one page full at a time.
.I nr_free_inodes
represents the number of free inodes.
.I preshrink

The value in this file determines whether core dump files are
produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries.
Three different integer values can be specified:
.sp
\fI0\ (default)\fP
This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13) behavior.
A core dump will not be produced for a process which has
changed credentials (by calling
.BR seteuid (2),
.BR setgid (2),
or similar, or by executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program)
or whose binary does not have read permission enabled.
.sp
\fI1\ ("debug")\fP
All processes dump core when possible.
The core dump is owned by the file system user ID of the dumping process
and no security is applied.
This is intended for system debugging situations only.
Ptrace is unchecked.
.sp
\fI2\ ("suidsafe")\fP
Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see "0" above)
is dumped readable by root only.
This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it.
For security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one
another or other files.
This mode is appropriate when administrators are
attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.

If BSD-style process accounting is enabled these values control
its behavior.
If free space on file system where the log lives goes below
.I lowwater
percent accounting suspends.
If free space gets above
.I highwater
percent accounting resumes.
.I frequency
determines
how often the kernel checks the amount of free space (value is in
seconds).
Default values are 4, 2 and 30.
That is, suspend accounting if 2% or less space is free; resume it
if 4% or more space is free; consider information about amount of free space

program to handle a graceful restart.
When the value is greater than zero, Linux's reaction to a Vulcan
Nerve Pinch (tm) will be an immediate reboot, without even
syncing its dirty buffers.
Note: when a program (like dosemu) has the keyboard in "raw"
mode, the ctrl-alt-del is intercepted by the program before it
ever reaches the kernel tty layer, and it's up to the program
to decide what to do with it.

These fields are, in order:
.RS
.IP SEMMSL 8
The maximum semaphores per semaphore set.
.IP SEMMNS 8
A system-wide limit on the number of semaphores in all semaphore sets.
.IP SEMOPM 8
The maximum number of operations that may be specified in a
.BR semop (2)

.I /proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff
This file
shows the size of the generic SCSI device (sg) buffer.
You can't tune it just yet, but you could change it at
compile time by editing
.I include/scsi/sg.h
and changing
the value of
.BR SG_BIG_BUFF .
However, there shouldn't be any reason to change this value.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/kernel/shmall
This file
contains the system-wide limit on the total number of pages of
System V shared memory.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
This file
can be used to query and set the run-time limit
on the maximum (System V IPC) shared memory segment size that can be
created.
Shared memory segments up to 1GB are now supported in the
kernel.
This value defaults to
.BR SHMMAX .
.TP
.I /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni
(available in Linux 2.4 and onwards)
This file
specifies the system-wide maximum number of System V shared memory
segments that can be created.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/kernel/version
This file contains a string like:

    #5 Wed Feb 25 21:49:24 MET 1998

The "#5" means that
this is the fifth kernel built from this source base and the
date behind it indicates the time the kernel was built.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max " (since Linux 2.3.11)"
This file specifies the system-wide limit on the number of
threads (tasks) that can be created on the system.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/zero-paged " (PowerPC only) "
This file
contains a flag.
When enabled (non-zero), Linux-PPC will pre-zero pages in
the idle loop, possibly speeding up get_free_pages.

.TP
.I /proc/sys/sunrpc
This directory supports Sun remote procedure call for network file system
(NFS).
On some systems, it is not present.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/vm
This directory contains files for memory management tuning, buffer and
cache management.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches " (since Linux 2.6.16)"
Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries and
inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.

To free pagecache, use
.IR "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" ;
to free dentries and inodes, use
.IR "echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" ;
to free pagecache, dentries and inodes, use
.IR "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" .

Because this is a non-destructive operation and dirty objects
are not freeable, the
user should run
.BR sync (8)
first.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout " (since Linux 2.6.9)"
.\" The following is from Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
If non-zero, this disables the new 32-bit memory-mapping layout;
the kernel will use the legacy (2.4) layout for all processes.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
.\" The following is from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
Enables a system-wide task dump (excluding kernel threads) to be
produced when the kernel performs an OOM-killing.
The dump includes the following information
for each task (thread, process):
thread ID, real user ID, thread group ID (process ID),
virtual memory size, resident set size,
the CPU that the task is scheduled on,
oom_adj score (see the description of
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_adj ),
and command name.
This is helpful to determine why the OOM-killer was invoked
and to identify the rogue task that caused it.

If this contains the value zero, this information is suppressed.
On very large systems with thousands of tasks,
it may not be feasible to dump the memory state information for each one.
Such systems should not be forced to incur a performance penalty in
OOM situations when the information may not be desired.

If this is set to non-zero, this information is shown whenever the
OOM-killer actually kills a memory-hogging task.

The default value is 0.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task " (since Linux 2.6.24)"
.\" The following is from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
This enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering task in
out-of-memory situations.

If this is set to zero, the OOM-killer will scan through the entire
tasklist and select a task based on heuristics to kill.
This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging task that
frees up a large amount of memory when killed.

If this is set to non-zero, the OOM-killer simply kills the task that
triggered the out-of-memory condition.
This avoids a possibly expensive tasklist scan.

If
.I /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom
is non-zero, it takes precedence over whatever value is used in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task .

The default value is 0.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode.
Values are:
.RS
.IP
0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
.br
1: always overcommit, never check
.br
2: always check, never overcommit
.RE
.IP
In mode 0, calls of
.BR mmap (2)
with
.B MAP_NORESERVE
are not checked, and the default check is very weak,
leading to the risk of getting a process "OOM-killed".
Under Linux 2.4 any non-zero value implies mode 1.
In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space
on the system is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)),
where SS is the size of the swap space, and RAM
is the size of the physical memory, and r is the contents of the file
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio .
.TP
.I /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
See the description of
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory .
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom " (since Linux 2.6.18)"
.\" The following is adapted from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
This enables or disables a kernel panic in
an out-of-memory situation.

If this file is set to the value 0,
the kernel's OOM-killer will kill some rogue process.
Usually, the OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the
system will survive.

If this file is set to the value 1,
then the kernel normally panics when out-of-memory happens.
However, if a process limits allocations to certain nodes
using memory policies
.RB ( mbind  (2)
.BR MPOL_BIND )
or cpusets
.RB ( cpuset (7))
and those nodes reach memory exhaustion status,
one process may be killed by the OOM-killer.
No panic occurs in this case:
because other nodes' memory may be free,
this means the system as a whole may not have reached
an out-of-memory situation yet.

If this file is set to the value 2,
the kernel always panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

The default value is 0.
1 and 2 are for failover of clustering.
Select either according to your policy of failover.
.TP
.I /proc/sysvipc
Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files
.IR msg ", "  sem " and "  shm "."

.SH NOTES
Many strings (i.e., the environment and command line) are in
the internal format, with sub-fields terminated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
so you
may find that things are more readable if you use \fIod \-c\fP or \fItr
"\\000" "\\n"\fP to read them.
Alternatively, \fIecho \`cat <file>\`\fP works well.

This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the kind
of thing that needs to be updated very often.
