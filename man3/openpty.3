.SH NAME
openpty, login_tty, forkpty \- tty utility functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <pty.h>
\ /* for openpty and forkpty */
.br
.B #include <utmp.h>
/* for login_tty */
.sp
.BI "int openpty(int *" amaster ", int *" aslave ", char *" name ", struct termios *" termp ", struct winsize * " winp );
.sp
.BI "int login_tty(int " fd );
.sp
.BI "pid_t forkpty(int *" amaster ", char *" name ", struct termios *" termp ", struct winsize *" winp );
.sp
Link with -lutil.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B openpty()
function finds an available pseudo-tty and returns file descriptors
for the master and slave in
.I amaster
and
.IR aslave .
If
.I name
is not NULL, the filename of the slave is returned in
.IR name .
If
.I termp
is not NULL, the terminal parameters of the slave will be set to the
values in
.IR termp .
If
.I winp
is not NULL, the window size of the slave will be set to the values in
.IR winp .

The
.B login_tty()
function prepares for a login on the tty
.I fd
(which may be a real tty device, or the slave of a pseudo-tty as
returned by
.BR openpty() )
by creating a new session, making
.I fd
the controlling terminal for the current process, setting
.I fd
to be the standard input, output, and error streams of the current
process, and closing
.IR fd .

The
.B forkpty()
function combines
.BR openpty() ,
.BR fork() ,
and
.B login_tty()
to create a new process operating in a pseudo-tty.  The file
descriptor of the master side of the pseudo-tty is returned in
.IR amaster ,
and the filename of the slave in
.I name
if it is not NULL.  The
.I termp
and
.I winp
parameters, if not NULL,
will determine the terminal attributes and window size of the slave
side of the pseudo-tty.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
If a call to
.BR openpty() ,
.BR login_tty() ,
or
.B forkpty()
is not successful, -1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.  Otherwise,
.BR openpty() ,
.BR login_tty() ,
and the child process of
.B forkpty()
return 0, and the parent process of
.B forkpty()
returns the process ID of the child process.
.SH ERRORS
.B openpty()
will fail if:
.TP
.B ENOENT
There are no available ttys.
.LP
.B login_pty()
will fail if
.B ioctl()
fails to set
.I fd
to the controlling terminal of the current process.
.LP
.B forkpty()
will fail if either
.B openpty()
or
.B fork()
fails.
.SH NOTE
These functions are included in libutil, hence you'll need to add
.B \-lutil
to your compiler commandline.
.SH FILES
.I /dev/[pt]ty[pqrstuwxyzabcdePQRST][0123456789abcdef]
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
These are BSD functions, present in libc5 and glibc2.
.SH BUGS
Nobody knows how much space should be reserved for
.IR name .
So, calling
.B openpty()
or
.B forkpty()
with non-NULL
.I name
may not be secure.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fork (2)
