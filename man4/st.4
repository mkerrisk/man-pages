.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B st
driver provides the interface to a variety of SCSI tape devices.
Currently, the driver takes control of all detected devices of type
\(lqsequential-access.\(rq
The
.B st
driver uses major device number 9.
.PP
Each device uses eight minor device numbers. The lower-most five bits
in the minor numbers are assigned sequentially in the order of
detection. The minor numbers can be grouped into
two sets of four numbers: the principal (auto-rewind) minor device numbers,
.IR n ,
and a \(lqno-rewind\(rq device numbers,
.IR "" ( n "+ 128)."
Devices opened using the principal device number will be sent a
\s-1REWIND\s+1 command when they are closed.
Devices opened using the \(lqno-rewind\(rq device number will not.
(Note that using an auto-rewind device for positioning the tape with,
for instance, mt does not lead to the desired result: the tape is
rewound after the mt command and the next command starts from the
beginning of the tape).
.PP
Within each group, four minor numbers are available to define
devices with different characteristics (block size, compression,
density, etc.) When the system starts up, only the first device is
available. The other three are activated when the default
characteristics are defined (see below). (By changing compile-time
constants, it is possible to change the balance between the maximum
number of tape drives and the number of minor numbers for each
drive. The default allocation allows control of 32 tape drives.
For instance, it is possible to control up to 64 tape drives
with two minor numbers for different options.)
.PP
Devices are typically created by:
.RS

.RE
.PP
There is no corresponding block device.
.PP
The driver uses an internal buffer that has to be large enough to hold
at least one tape block. In kernels before 2.1.121, the buffer is
allocated as one contiguous block. This limits the block size to the
largest contiguous block of memory the kernel allocator can provide.
The limit is currently 128 kB for the 32-bit architectures and
256 kB for the 64-bit architectures. In newer kernels the driver
allocates the buffer in several parts if necessary. By default, the
maximum number of parts is 16. This means that the maximum block size
is very large (2 MB if allocation of 16 blocks of 128 kB succeeds).
.PP
The driver's internal buffer size is determined by a compile-time
constant which can be overridden with a kernel startup option.
In addition to this, the driver tries to allocate a larger temporary
buffer at run-time if necessary. However, run-time allocation of large
contiguous blocks of memory may fail and it is advisable not to rely
too much on dynamic buffer allocation with kernels older than 2.1.121
(this applies also to demand-loading the driver with kerneld or kmod).
.PP
The driver does not specifically support any tape drive brand or
model. After system start-up the tape device options are defined by
the drive firmware. For example, if the drive firmware selects fixed
block mode, the tape device uses fixed block mode. The options can
be changed with explicit
.B ioctl()
calls and remain in effect when the device is closed and reopened.
Setting the options affects both the auto-rewind and the non-rewind
device.
.PP
Different options can be specified for the different devices within
the subgroup of four. The options take effect when the device is
opened. For example, the system administrator can define
one device that writes in fixed block mode with a certain block size,
and one which writes in variable block mode (if the drive supports
both modes).
.PP
The driver supports
.B tape partitions
if they are supported by the drive. (Note that the tape partitions
have nothing to do with disk partitions. A partitioned tape can be
seen as several logical tapes within one medium.) Partition
support has to be enabled with an ioctl. The tape
location is preserved within each partition across partition changes.
The partition used for subsequent tape operations is
selected with an ioctl. The partition switch is executed together with
the next tape operation in order to avoid unnecessary tape
movement. The maximum number of partitions on a tape is defined by a
compile-time constant (originally four). The driver contains an
ioctl that can format a tape with either one or two partitions.
.PP
Device
.B /dev/tape
is usually created as a hard or soft link to the default tape device
on the system.
.SH "DATA TRANSFER"
The driver supports operation in both fixed block mode and variable
block mode (if supported by the drive). In fixed block mode the drive
writes blocks of the specified size and the block size is not
dependent on the byte counts of the write system calls. In variable
block mode one tape block is written for each write call and the byte
count determines the size of the corresponding tape block. Note that
the blocks on the tape do don't contain any information about the
writing mode: when reading, the only important thing is to use
commands that accept the block sizes on the tape.
.PP
In variable block mode the read byte count does not have to match
the tape block size exactly. If the byte count is larger than the
next block on tape, the driver returns the data and the function
returns the actual block size. If the block size is larger than the
byte count, the requested amount of data from the start of the block
is returned and the rest of the block is discarded.
.PP
In fixed block mode the read byte counts can be arbitrary if
buffering is enabled, or a multiple of the tape block size if
buffering is disabled. Kernels before 2.1.121 allow writes with
arbitrary byte count if buffering is enabled. In all other cases
(kernel before 2.1.121 with buffering disabled or newer kernel) the
write byte count must be a multiple of the tape block size.
.PP
A filemark is automatically written to tape if the last tape operation
before close was a write.
.PP
When a filemark is encountered while reading, the following
happens. If there are data remaining in the buffer when the filemark
is found, the buffered data is returned. The next read returns zero
bytes. The following read returns data from the next file. The end of
recorded data is signaled by returning zero bytes for two consecutive
read calls. The third read returns an error.
.SH IOCTLS
The driver supports three ioctl requests.
Requests not recognized by the
.B st
driver are passed to the
.B SCSI
driver.
The definitions below are from
.BR /usr/include/linux/mtio.h :
.SS "\s-1MTIOCTOP\s+1 \- Perform a tape operation"
.PP
This request takes an argument of type
.BR "(struct mtop *)" .
Not all drives support all operations.
The driver returns an EIO error if the drive rejects an operation.

is non-zero and disable compression if
.B mt_count
is zero. This command uses the MODE page 15 supported by most DATs.
.IP MTEOM
Go to the end of the recorded media (for appending files).

.IP MTLOAD
Execute the SCSI load command. A special case is available for some HP
autoloaders. If
.B mt_count
is the constant MT_ST_HPLOADER_OFFSET plus a number, the number is
sent to the drive to control the autoloader.
.IP MTLOCK
Lock the tape drive door.
.IP MTMKPART
Format the tape into one or two partitions. If
.B mt_count
is non-zero, it gives the size of the first partition and the second
partition contains the rest of the tape. If
.B mt_count
is zero, the tape is formatted into one partition.
This command is not allowed for a drive unless the partition support
is enabled for the drive (see MT_ST_CAN_PARTITIONS below).
.IP MTNOP
No op \- flushes the driver's buffer as a side effect.
Should be used before reading status with \s-1MTIOCGET\s+1.
.IP MTOFFL
Rewind and put the drive off line.
.IP MTRESET
Reset drive.
.IP MTRETEN
Retension tape.
.IP MTREW
Rewind.
.IP MTSEEK
Seek to the tape block number specified in
.BR mt_count .
This operation requires either a SCSI-2 drive that supports the \s-1LOCATE\s+1
command (device-specific address)
or a Tandberg-compatible SCSI-1 drive (Tandberg, Archive
Viper, Wangtek, ... ).
The block number should be one that was previously returned by
\s-1MTIOCPOS\s+1 if device-specific addresses are used.
.IP MTSETBLK
Set the drive's block length to the value specified in
.BR mt_count .
A block length of zero sets the drive to variable block size mode.

.IP 2
The drive may report \s-1GOOD\s+1 status on write commands as soon as (a) all
the data has been transferred to the drive's internal buffer, and
(b) all buffered data from different initiators has been successfully
written to the medium.
.PD
.RE
.IP ""
To control the write threshold the value in
.B mt_count
must include the constant
\s-1MT_ST_WRITE_THRESHOLD\s+1 logically ORed with a block count in the low 28
bits.
The block count refers to 1024-byte blocks, not the physical block
size on the tape.
The threshold cannot exceed the driver's internal buffer size (see
.BR \s-1DESCRIPTION\s+1 ,
above).
.IP
To set and clear the Boolean options
the value in
.B mt_count
must include one the constants \s-1MT_ST_BOOLEANS\s+1,
\s-1MT_ST_SETBOOLEANS\s+1, \s-1MT_ST_CLEARBOOLEANS\s+1, or
\s-1MT_ST_DEFBOOLEANS\s+1 logically ORed with
whatever combination of the following options is desired.
Using \s-1MT_ST_BOOLEANS\s+1 the options can be set to the values
defined in the corresponding bits. With \s-1MT_ST_SETBOOLEANS\s+1 the
options can be selectively set and with \s-1MT_ST_DEFBOOLEANS\s+1
selectively cleared.
.IP ""
The default options for a tape device are set with
\s-1MT_ST_DEFBOOLEANS\s+1. A non-active tape device (e.g., device with
minor 32 or 160) is activated when the default options for it are
defined the first time. An activated device inherits from the device
activated at start-up the options not set explicitly.
.IP ""
The Boolean options are:
.IP
.PD 0
.RS
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_BUFFER_WRITES\s+1  (Default: true)"
Buffer all write operations in fixed block mode.
If this option is false and the drive uses a fixed block size, then
all write operations must be for a multiple of the block size.
This option must be set false to write reliable multi-volume archives.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_ASYNC_WRITES\s+1  (Default: true)"
When this options is true write operations return immediately without
waiting for the data to be transferred to the drive if the data fits
into the driver's buffer.
The write threshold determines how full the buffer must be before a
new SCSI write command is issued.
Any errors reported by the drive will be held until the next
operation.
This option must be set false to write reliable multi-volume archives.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_READ_AHEAD\s+1  (Default: true)"
This option causes the driver to provide read buffering and
read-ahead in fixed block mode.
If this option is false and the drive uses a fixed block size, then
all read operations must be for a multiple of the block size.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_TWO_FM\s+1  (Default: false)"
This option modifies the driver behavior when a file is closed.
The normal action is to write a single filemark.
If the option is true the driver will write two filemarks and
backspace over the second one.
.PD
.IP
Note:
This option should not be set true for QIC tape drives since they are
unable to overwrite a filemark.
These drives detect the end of recorded data by testing for blank tape
rather than two consecutive filemarks. Most other current drives also
detect the end of recorded data and using two filemarks is usually
necessary only when interchanging tapes with some other systems.
.PP
.PD 0
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_DEBUGGING\s+1  (Default: false)"
This option turns on various debugging messages from the driver
(effective only if the driver was compiled with \s-1DEBUG\s+1 defined
non-zero).
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_FAST_EOM\s+1  (Default: false)"
This option causes the \s-1MTEOM\s+1 operation to be sent directly to the
drive, potentially speeding up the operation but causing the driver to
lose track of the current file number normally returned by the
\s-1MTIOCGET\s+1 request.
If \s-1MT_ST_FAST_EOM\s+1 is false the driver will respond to an
\s-1MTEOM\s+1 request by forward spacing over files.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_AUTO_LOCK\s+1 (Default: false)"
When this option is true, the drive door is locked when the device is
opened and unlocked when it is closed.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_DEF_WRITES\s+1 (Default: false)"
The tape options (block size, mode, compression, etc.) may change
when changing from one device linked to a drive to another device
linked to the same drive depending on how the devices are
defined. This option defines when the changes are enforced by the
driver using SCSI-commands and when the drives auto-detection
capabilities are relied upon. If this option is false, the driver
sends the SCSI-commands immediately when the device is changed. If the
option is true, the SCSI-commands are not sent until a write is
requested. In this case the drive firmware is allowed to detect the
tape structure when reading and the SCSI-commands are used only to
make sure that a tape is written according to the correct specification.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_CAN_BSR\s+1 (Default: false)"
When read-ahead is used, the tape must sometimes be spaced backward to the
correct position when the device is closed and the SCSI command to
space backwards over records is used for this purpose. Some older
drives can't process this command reliably and this option can be used
to instruct the driver not to use the command. The end result is that,
with read-ahead and fixed block mode, the tape may not be correctly
positioned within a file when the device is closed.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_NO_BLKLIMS\s+1 (Default: false)"
Some drives don't accept the READ BLOCK LIMITS SCSI command. If
this is used, the driver does not use the command. The drawback is
that the driver can't check before sending commands if the selected
block size is acceptable to the drive.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_CAN_PARTITIONS\s+1 (Default: false)"
This option enables support for several partitions within a
tape. The option applies to all devices linked to a drive.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_SCSI2LOGICAL\s+1 (Default: false)"
This option instructs the driver to use the logical block addresses
defined in the SCSI-2 standard when performing the seek and tell
operations (both with MTSEEK and MTIOCPOS commands and when changing tape
partition). Otherwise the device-specific addresses are used.
It is highly advisable to set this option if the drive supports the
logical addresses because they count also filemarks. There are some
drives that only support the logical block addresses.
.IP "\s-1MT_ST_SYSV\s+1 (Default: false)"
When this option is enabled, the tape devices use the SystemV
semantics. Otherwise the BSD semantics are used. The most important
difference between the semantics is what happens when a device used
for reading is closed: in SYSV semantics the tape is spaced forward
past the next filemark if this has not happened while using the
device. In BSD semantics the tape position is not changed.

starting from a driver written by Dwayne Forsyth. Several other
people have also contributed to the driver.

The file README.st in the kernel sources contains the most recent
information about the driver and its configuration
possibilities.
.SH NOTES
1. When exchanging data between systems, both systems have to agree on
the physical tape block size. The parameters of a drive after startup
are often not the ones most operating systems use with these
devices. Most systems use drives in variable block mode if the drive
supports that mode. This applies to most modern drives, including
DATs, 8mm helical scan drives, DLTs, etc. It may be advisable use
these drives in variable block mode also in Linux (i.e., use MTSETBLK
or MTSETDEFBLK at system startup to set the mode), at least when
exchanging data with foreign system. The drawback of
this is that a fairly large tape block size has to be used to get
acceptable data transfer rates on the SCSI bus.
.PP
2. Many programs (e.g., tar) allow the user to specify the blocking
factor on command line. Note that this determines the physical block
size on tape only in variable block mode.
.PP
3. In order to use SCSI tape drives, the basic SCSI driver,
a SCSI-adapter driver and the SCSI tape driver must be either
configured into the kernel or loaded as modules. If the SCSI-tape
driver is not present, the drive is recognized but the tape support
described in this page is not available.
.PP
4. The driver writes error messages to the console/log. The SENSE
codes written into some messages are automatically translated to text
if verbose SCSI messages are enabled in kernel configuration.
