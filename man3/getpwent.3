.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR getpwent ()
function returns a pointer to a structure containing
the broken-out fields of a record from the password database
(e.g., the local password file
.IR /etc/passwd ,
NIS, and LDAP).
The first time it
is called it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns successive
entries.
.PP
The
.BR setpwent ()
function rewinds to the beginning
of the password database.
.PP
The
.BR endpwent ()
function is used to close the password database
after all processing has been performed.
.PP
The \fIpasswd\fP structure is defined in \fI<pwd.h>\fP as follows:
.sp
.in +4n
.nf
struct passwd {
    char   *pw_name;       /* username */
    char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
    uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
    gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
    char   *pw_gecos;      /* real name */
    char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
    char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
};
.fi
.in
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR getpwent ()
function returns a pointer to a
.I passwd
structure, or NULL if
there are no more entries or an error occurs.
If an error occurs,
.I errno
is set appropriately.
If one wants to check
.I errno
after the call, it should be set to zero before the call.

The return value may point to a static area, and may be overwritten
by subsequent calls to
.BR getpwent (),
.BR getpwnam (3),
or
.BR getpwuid (3).
