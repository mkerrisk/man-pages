.sp
.BI "double copysign(double " x ", double " y );
.br
.BI "float copysignf(float " x ", float " y );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBcopysign()\fP functions return a value whose absolute value matches
that of \fIx\fP, but whose sign matches that of \fIy\fP.
If \fIx\fP is a NaN, then a NaN with the sign of \fIy\fP is returned.
.SH NOTES
The \fBcopysign()\fP functions may treat a negative zero as positive.
