.BR pthread_sigqueue ():
_GNU_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_sigqueue ()
function performs a similar task to
.BR sigqueue (2),
but, rather than sending a signal to another process,
it sends a signal to another thread in the same process as the
calling thread.

The
.I thread
argument is the ID of another thread in the same process as the caller.
The
.I sig
argument specifies the signal to be sent.
The
.I value
argument specifies data to accompany the signal; see
.BR sigqueue (2)
for details.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR pthread_sigqueue ()
returns 0;
on error, it returns an error number.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EAGAIN
The limit of signals which may be queued has been reached.
(See
.BR signal (7)
for further information.)
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I sig
was invalid.
.TP
.B ENOSYS
.BR pthread_sigqueue ()
is not supported on this system.
.TP
.B ESRCH
.I thread
is not valid.
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR pthread_sigqueue ()
function first appeared in glibc 2.11.
It is implemented using the Linux-specific
.BR rt_tgsigqueinfo ()
system call, which was added in Linux 2.6.31.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This function is a GNU extension.
