.SH NAME
fallocate \- manipulate file space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.B #include <fcntl.h>

.BI "int fallocate(int " fd ", int " mode ", off_t " offset \
", off_t " len ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a nonportable, Linux-specific system call.
For the portable, POSIX.1-specified method of ensuring that space
is allocated for a file, see
.BR posix_fallocate (3).

.BR fallocate ()
allows the caller to directly manipulate the allocated disk space
for the file referred to by
.I fd
for the byte range starting at
.I offset
and continuing for
.I len
bytes.

The
.I mode
argument determines the operation to be performed on the given range.
Currently only one flag is supported for
.IR mode :
.TP
.B FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE
This flag allocates and initializes to zero the disk space
within the range specified by
.I offset
and
.IR len .
After a successful call, subsequent writes into this range
are guaranteed not to fail because of lack of disk space.
Preallocating zeroed blocks beyond the end of the file
is useful for optimizing append workloads.
Preallocating blocks does not change
the file size (as reported by
.BR stat (2))
even if it is less than
.IR offset + len .
.\"
.\" Note from Amit Arora:
.\" There were few more flags which were discussed, but none of
.\" them have been finalized upon. Here are these flags:
.\" FA_FL_DEALLOC, FA_FL_DEL_DATA, FA_FL_ERR_FREE, FA_FL_NO_MTIME,
.\" FA_FL_NO_CTIME
.\" All of the above flags were debated upon and we can not say
.\" if any/which one of these flags will make it to the later kernels.
.PP
If
.B FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE
flag is not specified in
.IR mode ,
the default behavior is almost same as when this flag is specified.
The only difference is that on success,
the file size will be changed if
.I "offset + len"
is greater than the file size.
This default behavior closely resembles the behavior of the
.BR posix_fallocate (3)
library function,
and is intended as a method of optimally implementing that function.
.PP
Because allocation is done in block size chunks,
.BR fallocate ()
may allocate a larger range than that which was specified.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR fallocate ()
returns zero on success, and -1 on failure.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor, or is not opened for writing.
.TP
.B EFBIG
.IR offset + len
exceeds the maximum file size.
.TP
.B EINTR
A signal was caught during execution.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I offset
was less than 0, or
.I len
was less than or equal to 0.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file system.
.TP
.B ENODEV
.I fd
does not refer to a regular file or a directory.
(If
.I fd
is a pipe or FIFO, a different error results.)
.TP
.B ENOSPC
There is not enough space left on the device containing the file
referred to by
.IR fd .
.TP
.B ENOSYS
The file system containing the file referred to by
.I fd
does not support this operation.
.TP
.B EOPNOTSUPP
The
.I mode
is not supported by the file system containing the file referred to by
.IR fd .
.SH VERSIONS
.BR fallocate ()
is available on Linux since kernel 2.6.23.
Support is provided by glibc since version 2.10.
.SH CONFORMING TO
