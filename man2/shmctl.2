.TH SHMCTL 2 2004-06-17 "Linux 2.6.7" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
shmctl \- shared memory control
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ad l
.B #include <sys/ipc.h>
.sp
.B #include <sys/shm.h>
.sp
.BI "int shmctl(int " shmid ", int " cmd ", struct shmid_ds *" buf );
.ad b
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBshmctl()\fP
allows the user to receive information on a shared memory segment,
set the owner, group, and permissions of a shared memory segment,
or destroy a segment. The information about the segment identified by
\fIshmid\fP is returned in a \fIshmid_ds\fP
structure:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
struct shmid_ds {
    struct ipc_perm shm_perm;  /* operation perms */
    int shm_segsz;             /* size of segment (bytes) */
    time_t shm_atime;          /* last attach time */
    time_t shm_dtime;          /* last detach time */
    time_t shm_ctime;          /* last change time */
    unsigned short shm_cpid;   /* pid of creator */
    unsigned short shm_lpid;   /* pid of last operator */
    short shm_nattch;          /* no. of current attaches */
    ...
};
.fi
.in -4n
.PP
The highlighted fields in the member \fIshm_perm\fP can be set:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
struct ipc_perm {
    key_t  key;
    \fBushort uid\fP;   /* \fBowner\fP euid and egid */
    \fBushort gid\fP;
    ushort cuid;  /* creator euid and egid */
    ushort cgid;
    \fBushort mode\fP;  /* lower 9 bits of access modes */
    ushort seq;   /* sequence number */
};
.fi
.in -4n
.PP
The following \fIcmds\fP are available:
.br
.TP 12
.B IPC_STAT
is used to copy the information about the shared memory segment into
the buffer \fIbuf\fP. The user must have \fBread\fP access to the
shared memory segment.
.TP
.B IPC_SET
is used to apply the changes the user has made to the \fIuid\fP, \fIgid\fP,
or \fImode\fP members of the \fIshm_perms\fP field.  Only the lowest 9 bits
of \fImode\fP are used.  The
.I shm_ctime
member is also updated.  The user must be the owner or creator, or be
privileged.
.TP
.B IPC_RMID
is used to mark the segment as destroyed. It will actually be destroyed
after the last detach.  (I.e., when the
.I shm_nattch
member of the associated structure
.I shmid_ds
is zero.)  The user must be the owner or creator, or be privileged.
.PP
The user \fImust\fP ensure that a segment is eventually destroyed; otherwise
its pages that were faulted in will remain in memory or swap.
.SS "Linux additions"
A privileged user can prevent or allow swapping of a shared
memory segment with the following \fIcmds\fP:
.br
.TP 12
.B SHM_LOCK
prevents swapping of a shared memory segment. The user must fault in
any pages that are required to be present after locking is enabled.
.TP
.B SHM_UNLOCK
allows the shared memory segment to be swapped out.
.PP
The
.BR IPC_INFO ,
.BR SHM_STAT
and
.B SHM_INFO
control calls are used by the
.BR ipcs (8)
program to provide information on allocated resources.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 11
.B EACCES
\fBIPC_STAT\fP or \fBSHM_STAT\fP is requested and
\fIshm_perm.modes\fP does not allow read access for
.IR shmid ,
and the calling process does not have the
.BR CAP_IPC_OWNER
capability.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The argument
.I cmd
has value
.B IPC_SET
or
.B IPC_STAT
but the address pointed to by
.I buf
isn't accessible.
.TP
.B EIDRM
\fIshmid\fP points to a removed identifier.
.TP
.B EINVAL
\fIshmid\fP is not a valid identifier, or \fIcmd\fP
is not a valid command.
.TP
.B EOVERFLOW
\fBIPC_STAT\fP is attempted, and the gid or uid value
is too large to be stored in the structure pointed to by
.IR buf . 
.TP
.B EPERM
\fBIPC_SET\fP or \fBIPC_RMID\fP is attempted, and the
effective user ID of the calling process is not that of the creator
(found in
.IR shm_perm.cuid ),
or the owner
(found in
.IR shm_perm.uid ),
and the process was not privileged (Linux: did not have the
.B CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability).

Or,
.B SHM_LOCK
or
.B SHM_UNLOCK
was specified, but the process was not privileged
(Linux: did not have the
.B CAP_IPC_LOCK
capability).
.SH NOTE
Various fields in a \fIstruct shmid_ds\fP were shorts under Linux 2.2
and have become longs under Linux 2.4. To take advantage of this,
a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later should suffice.
(The kernel distinguishes old and new calls by an IPC_64 flag in
.IR cmd .)
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID.  SVr4 documents additional error conditions EINVAL,
ENOENT, ENOSPC, ENOMEM, EEXIST.  Neither SVr4 nor SVID documents
an EIDRM error condition.
