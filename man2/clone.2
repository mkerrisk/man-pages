.SH DESCRIPTION
.B clone 
creates a new process, just like
.BR fork (2).
.B clone
is a library function layered on top
of the underlying 
.BR clone
system call, hereinafter referred to as
.BR sys_clone .
A description of
.BR sys_clone
is given towards the end of this page.

Unlike
.BR fork (2),
these calls 
allow the child process to share parts of its execution context with
the calling process, such as the memory space, the table of file
descriptors, and the table of signal handlers.  (Note that on this manual 
page, "calling process" normally corresponds to "parent process".  But see
the description of 
.B CLONE_PARENT 
below.)

The main use of
.B clone
is to implement threads: multiple threads of control in a program that
run concurrently in a shared memory space.

When the child process is created with
.BR clone , 
it executes the function
application
.IR fn ( arg ).  
(This differs from
.BR fork (2), 
where execution continues in the child from the point
of the 
.BR fork (2) 
call.)
The
.I fn
argument is a pointer to a function that is called by the child
process at the beginning of its execution.
The
.I arg
argument is passed to the
.I fn
function.

When the 
.IR fn ( arg )
function application returns, the child process terminates.  The
integer returned by
.I fn
is the exit code for the child process.  The child process may also
terminate explicitly by calling
.BR exit (2)
or after receiving a fatal signal.

The
.I child_stack
argument specifies the location of the stack used by the child
process.  Since the child and calling process may share memory,
it is not possible for the child process to execute in the
same stack as the calling process.  The calling process must therefore
set up memory space for the child stack and pass a pointer to this
space to
.BR clone .
Stacks grow downwards on all processors that run Linux
(except the HP PA processors), so
.I child_stack
usually points to the topmost address of the memory space set up for
the child stack.

The low byte of
.I flags
contains the number of the signal sent to the parent when the child
dies.  If this signal is specified as anything other than
.BR SIGCHLD ,
then the parent process must specify the
.B __WALL 
or 
.B __WCLONE
options when waiting for the child with 
.BR wait (2).  
If no signal is specified, then the parent process is not signaled
when the child terminates.

.I flags
may also be bitwise-or'ed with one or several of the following
constants, in order to specify what is shared between the calling process
and the child process:

.TP
.BR CLONE_PARENT " (since Linux 2.3.12)"
If
.B CLONE_PARENT
is set, then the parent of the new child (as returned by
.BR getppid (2))
will be the same as that of the calling process.

If
.B CLONE_PARENT
is not set, then (as with
.BR fork (2))
the child's parent is the calling process.

Note that it is the parent process, as returned by 
.BR getppid (2),
which is signaled when the child terminates, so that
if 
.B CLONE_PARENT
is set, then the parent of the calling process, rather than the 
calling process itself, will be signaled.

.TP
.B CLONE_FS
If
.B CLONE_FS
is set, the caller and the child processes share the same file system
information.  This includes the root of the file system, the current
working directory, and the umask.  Any call to
.BR chroot (2),
.BR chdir (2),
or
.BR umask (2)
performed by the calling process or the child process also takes effect in the
other process.

If 
.B CLONE_FS
is not set, the child process works on a copy of the file system
information of the calling process at the time of the
.BR clone 
call.
Calls to
.BR chroot (2),
.BR chdir (2),
.BR umask (2)
performed later by one of the processes do not affect the other process.

.TP
.B CLONE_FILES
If
.B CLONE_FILES
is set, the calling process and the child processes share the same file
descriptor table.  File descriptors always refer to the same files in
the calling process and in the child process.  Any file descriptor created by
the calling process or by the child process is also valid in the other
process.  Similarly, if one of the processes closes a file descriptor,
or changes its associated flags, the other process is also affected.

If
.B CLONE_FILES
is not set, the child process inherits a copy of all file descriptors
opened in the calling process at the time of
.BR clone .
Operations on file descriptors performed later by either the calling process or
the child process do not affect the other process.

.TP
.BR CLONE_NEWNS " (since Linux 2.4.19)
Start the child in a new namespace.

Every process lives in a namespace. The
.I namespace
of a process is the data (the set of mounts) describing the file hierarchy
as seen by that process. After a
.BR fork (2)
or
.BR clone (2)
where the
.B CLONE_NEWNS
flag is not set, the child lives in the same namespace as the parent.
The system calls
.BR mount (2)
and
.BR umount (2)
change the namespace of the calling process, and hence affect
all processes that live in the same namespace, but do not affect
processes in a different namespace.

After a
.BR clone (2)
where the
.B CLONE_NEWNS
flag is set, the cloned child is started in a new namespace,
initialized with a copy of the namespace of the parent.

Only a privileged process (one having the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability)
may specify the
.B CLONE_NEWNS
flag.
It is not permitted to specify both
.B CLONE_NEWNS
and
.B CLONE_FS
in the same
.BR clone 
call.

.TP
.B CLONE_SIGHAND
If
.B CLONE_SIGHAND
is set, the calling process and the child processes share the same table of
signal handlers.  If the calling process or child process calls
.BR sigaction (2)
to change the behavior associated with a signal, the behavior is 
changed in the other process as well.  However, the calling process and child
processes still have distinct signal masks and sets of pending
signals.  So, one of them may block or unblock some signals using
.BR sigprocmask (2)
without affecting the other process.

If
.B CLONE_SIGHAND
is not set, the child process inherits a copy of the signal handlers
of the calling process at the time
.B clone
is called.  Calls to
.BR sigaction (2)
performed later by one of the processes have no effect on the other
process.

.TP
.B CLONE_PTRACE
If 
.B CLONE_PTRACE
is specified, and the calling process is being traced, then trace the child also (see
.BR ptrace (2)).

.TP
.B CLONE_VFORK
If
.B CLONE_VFORK
is set, the execution of the calling process is suspended
until the child releases its virtual memory
resources via a call to
.BR execve (2)
or
.BR _exit (2)
(as with 
.BR vfork (2)).

If 
.B CLONE_VFORK
is not set then both the calling process and the child are schedulable
after the call, and an application should not rely on execution occurring
in any particular order.

.TP
.B CLONE_VM
If
.B CLONE_VM
is set, the calling process and the child processes run in the same memory
space.  In particular, memory writes performed by the calling process
or by the child process are also visible in the other process.
Moreover, any memory mapping or unmapping performed with
.BR mmap (2)
or
.BR munmap (2)
by the child or calling process also affects the other process.

If
.B CLONE_VM
is not set, the child process runs in a separate copy of the memory
space of the calling process at the time of
.BR clone .
Memory writes or file mappings/unmappings performed by one of the
processes do not affect the other, as with
.BR fork (2).

.TP
.BR CLONE_PID " (obsolete)"
If
.B CLONE_PID
is set, the child process is created with the same process ID as 
the calling process. This is good for hacking the system, but otherwise
of not much use. Since 2.3.21 this flag can be
specified only by the system boot process (PID 0).
It disappeared in Linux 2.5.16.

.TP
.BR CLONE_THREAD " (since Linux 2.4.0-test8)"
If
.B CLONE_THREAD
is set, the child is placed in the same thread group as the calling process.
.\" For a while there was CLONE_DETACHED (introduced in 2.5.32):
.\" parent wants no child-exit signal. In 2.6.2 the need to give this
.\" together with CLONE_THREAD disappeared.

If
.B CLONE_THREAD
is not set, then the child is placed in its own (new) 
thread group, whose ID is the same as the process ID.

(Thread groups are feature added in Linux 2.4 to support the
POSIX threads notion of a set of threads sharing a single PID.  In Linux
since 2.4, calls to 
.BR getpid (2)
return the thread group ID of the caller.)

.TP
.BR CLONE_SETTLS " (since Linux 2.5.32)"
The
.I newtls
parameter is the new TLS (Thread Local Storage) descriptor.
(See
.BR set_thread_area (2).)

.TP
.BR CLONE_PARENT_SETTID " (since Linux 2.5.49)"
Store child thread ID at location
.I parent_tidptr
in parent and child memory.
(In Linux 2.5.32-2.5.48 there was a flag CLONE_SETTID that did this.)

.TP
.BR CLONE_CHILD_SETTID " (since Linux 2.5.49)"
Store child thread ID at location
.I child_tidptr
in child memory.

.TP
.BR CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID " (since Linux 2.5.49)"
Erase child thread ID at location
.I child_tidptr
in child memory when the child exits, and do a wakeup on the futex
at that address.
The address involved may be changed by the
.BR set_tid_address (2)
system call. This is used by threading libraries.


.SS "sys_clone"
The
.B sys_clone
system call corresponds more closely to
.BR fork (2)
in that execution in the child continues from the point of the
call.  Thus,
.B sys_clone
only requires the
.I flags
and 
.I child_stack
arguments, which have the same meaning as for 
.BR clone .  
(Note that the order of these arguments differs from
.BR clone .)  

Another difference for 
.B sys_clone
is that the
.I child_stack
argument may be zero, in which case copy-on-write semantics ensure that the 
child gets separate copies of stack pages when either process modifies
the stack.  In this case, for correct operation, the 
.B CLONE_VM
option should not be specified.

Since Linux 2.5.49 the system call has five parameters.
The two new parameters are
.I parent_tidptr
which points to the location (in parent and child memory) where
the parent thread ID will be written in case CLONE_PARENT_SETTID
was specified, and
.I child_tidptr
which points to the location (in child memory) where the child thread ID
will be written in case CLONE_CHILD_SETTID was specified.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.\" gettid() returns current->pid;
.\" getpid() returns current->tgid;
On success, the thread ID of the child process is returned
in the caller's thread of execution.  On failure, a \-1 will be returned
in the caller's context, no child process will be created, and
.I errno
will be set appropriately.

.SH ERRORS

.SH AVAILABILITY
There is no entry for
.B clone
in libc5.  glibc2 provides
.B clone
as described in this manual page.

.SH NOTES
For kernel versions 2.4.7-2.4.18 the CLONE_THREAD flag implied the
CLONE_PARENT flag.

.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.B clone
and
.B sys_clone
calls are Linux-specific and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.
