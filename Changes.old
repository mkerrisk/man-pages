Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Fabian Kreutz
        Many math pages had their synopses compressed, as per suggestion
        from Fabian Kreutz.

Various pages
    Fabian Kreutz / aeb
        Many minor content and formatting bug fixes were made to the math
        pages, following suggestions from Fabian Kreutz (who recently
        translated many of the 1.70 math pages into German) and
        Andries Brouwer.

Various pages
    mtk
        For consistency, all instances of "super-user" were changed
        to the more common "superuser".

Various pages
    Vasya Pupkin / mtk
        After a note from Vasya Pupkin, I added <errno.h> to the SYNOPSIS
        of several Section 2 pages using the _syscallN() macros.

        In addition:
            -- erroneous semicolons at the end of _syscallN() were removed
               on various pages.

            -- types such as "uint" in syscallN() declarations were changed
               to "unsigned int", etc.

            -- various other minor breakages in the synopses were fixed.

        The affected pages are:

                getdents.2
                gettid.2
                llseek.2
                mmap2.2
                modify_ldt.2
                pivot_root.2
                quotactl.2
                readdir.2
                sysctl.2
                syslog.2
                tkill.2

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

initgroups.3
mkstemp.3

readdir.3
telldir.3
    Matthew Dempsky, mtk
        triggered by http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=283179
        The wording describing how errno is set was fixed up in these pages.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

sendfile.2
    mtk
        Adjusted descriptions of argument file types to be closer to
        2.6 reality.
        Wording and formatting changes.

ctan.3
ctanh.3
    Tony Crawford
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=270817
        Formulae on the pages should be T = S / C not T = C / S.

errno.3
    Martin Schulze, mtk
        Removed errno declaration from prototype, added notes
        on historical need for this declaration.
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=174175

aio_return.3
    as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=224953
        Changed erroneous "aio_return(2)" to "aio_return(3)".

posix_openpt.3
    mtk
        New by mtk

ptsname.3
    mtk
        Added description of ptsname_r().
        Added ERRORS.

ptsname_r.3
    mtk
        New link to ptsname.3.

shm_open.3
    Matthew Gregan
        add <fcntl.h> to synopsis
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271243

strcasecmp.3
    Marek Habersack
            .SH "CONFORMING TO"
            -BSD 4.4
            +BSD 4.4, SUSv3
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234443

strfry.3
    Joshua Kwan
        Added _GNU_SOURCE to prototype
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=213538

strftime.3
    Cartsen Hey
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276248

        Changed range for "%S" from 0..61 to 0..60.

        SUSv3 says 0..60.  I think the manual page probably says
        0..61, because that's what SUSv2 said.
        (Some other implementations' man pages also say 0..61 --
        e.g., Solaris 8 & 9, Tru64 5.1B; FreeBSD 5.1 says 0..60.)

        The glibc manual currently says 0..60.

        Given that SUSv3 says 0..60, I've changed the
        manual page to also say this:

            -The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
            +The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).
            +(The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)

sysconf.3
    Johannes Berg
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=226974
        -.BR POSIX2_FORT_RUN " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV
        +.BR POSIX2_FORT_DEV " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV

system.3
    Pedro Zorzenon
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=242638
        Noted use of _XOPEN_SOURCE to get macros from <stdlib.h>
        for wait(2).

    mtk
        Changed name of argument from 'string' to 'command' (like POSIX).

        Noted that glibc does nowadays explicitly check for the existence
        of the shell if 'command' is NULL, rather than the older behavior
        of assuming the shell exists and always returning 1 if
        'command' is NULL.

        Other wording and formatting clean-ups.

undocumented.3
    Remove some functions names that *are* documented.

    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Removed SEE ALSO reference to nonexistent newctime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=236884

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Changes to individual pages

epoll_create.2
    Marko Kohtala  / mtk
        Improved various error descriptions.

epoll_wait.2
    David Lloyd / Mike Frysinger, Marko Kohtala
        Added EINTR to errors.

fcntl.2
    Jamie Lokier / mtk
        Improved discussion of F_SETOWN and F_SETSIG with respect to
        multi-threaded programs.
        Generally cleaned up the discussion of F_SETOWN.

        Updated CONFORMING TO to note that F_GETOWN and F_SETOWN are
        now in POSIX.

link.2
    mtk
        Noted discrepancy between Linux and POSIX.1 when oldpath
        is a symbolic link.
        See: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367
        and: http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/ag/msg08152.html

    Michael Haardt / mtk
        Clarified EXDEV error description: it isn't possible to link
        across mount points, even if the mount points refer to the same
        file system.

mincore.2
    mtk, after note from Gordon Jin
        Updated ERRORS.

pipe.2
    As per message from Serguei Leontiev
        Removed SVr2, AT&T, and BSD from CONFORMING TO, since
        a pipe on those systems is actually bidirectional.
        (Pipes are implemented as STREAMS on the former, and
        sockets on the latter.)

posix_fadvise.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version where posix_fadvise() appeared and
        noted bug in handling of 'len' in kernels < 2.6.6.

        the same file system.

semop.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version numbers for semtimedop().

    Johan Walles, Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Added sigqueue.2 to SEE ALSO.

times.2
    mtk
        Added notes on non-standard behavior: Linux allows 'buf' to
        be NULL, but POSIX.1 doesn't specify this and it's non-portable.

uselib.2
    Andries Brouwer
        Improved DESCRIPTION; clarified distinction between
        EACCES and ENOEXEC.

bcopy.3
    Heikki Orsila
        bcopy() handles overlapping case, but memcpy() does not,
        so for consistency memmove() should be also mentioned.

getmntent_r.3
    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        New link to man3/getmntent.3.

memcpy.3
    Small wording change after suggestion from Sasa Stevanovic.

    aeb
        Improved description of read from /dev/urandom.

st.4
    Kai Makisara
        Substantial updates.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.10 ====================

Released: 2005-10-19

Global changes
--------------

The changes in this release consist *solely* of formatting fixes, with
the aim bringing greater consistency to the manual pages according to
the following rules:

-- Function name references should *always* be followed by
   parentheses, "()" (possibly containing a manual page section
   number).

-- The parentheses following a function name should *not* be
   formatted.  Thus, for example, instead of:

       .B name()

   one should write:

       .BR name ()

Much of the change was automated using two scripts:
add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh and unformat_parens.sh.
For the (possible) benefit of downstream manual page maintainers and
translators, I have placed these scripts in a new subdirectory 'scripts'.

NOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS WELL:

-- These scripts provide a computer-assisted solution to the above
   two goals.  However, they are not perfect, and their output should
   be scanned by a human.  (To see what changes the two scripts
   *would* make, without making them, use the "-n" command line option.)

-- The scripts do not fix all instances that violate the above rules:
   some manual fixes are required.  Two further scripts are provided
   to help find remaining instances of function names without
   following "()": find_dots_no_parens.sh and find_slashes_no_parens.sh.

The following changes were made:

-- add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh was applied to the pages in Sections
   2 and 3.

-- unformat_parens.sh was applied to pages in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7
   (the only sections where such changes were required).

-- further changes (not so very many) were performed by hand.
   (found places to fix with the assistance of find_dots_no_parens.sh
   and find_slashes_no_parens.sh).

Various pages
    mtk
        Most instances of the constant "NULL" are not formatted (bolded) in
        man pages, but a few are.  For consistency, formatting on "NULL" has
        been removed where it occurred.

        Many minor formatting fixes were made.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getrlimit.2
    mtk
        Added EINVAL error for rlim_cur > rlim_max when calling setrlimit().

path_resolution.2
    mtk
        Repaired discussion of capabilities and file system UID, which
        mistakenly had involved exec() in the discussion.

prctl.2
    mtk
        Removed text saying there is no library interface.  There
        is nowadays.

mkfifo.3
    mtk

    mtk
        Reworded text around PAGESIZE, noting also that
        sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) can be used.

path_resolution.2
    mtk / aeb
        Removed words "as well" (added in 2.11) from the phrase
        "and it gets these last five capabilities if its fsuid is 0 as well"
        since there are (unusual) situations in which fsuid can be 0 while
        the effective UID is not.

        Reworked (cut down) discussion of capabilities, moving part of
        it into capabilities.7

setresuid.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that setresuid() always modifies the file
        system UID, and setresgid() likewise always modifies the file
        system GID.

    mtk
        Added (brief) description of SHM_HUGETLB.

sigaltstack.2
    mtk / Martin Landers

    Brian M. Carlson  / herbert
        Change <netinet/in.h> to <arpa/inet.h> in prototype; add text
        explaining that some systems need the former header.
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=265244

capabilities.7
    mtk
        Reworked part of the discussion of exec() and capabilities.
        Added sub-section "Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities".
        Reworked discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN and file-max.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.13 ====================

Released: 2005-11-03

This release consists entirely of formatting and typographical fixes.

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Function and page cross references that were italicized were
        made bold (which is how the majority of function and page
        cross references were already done).

Various pages
    mtk
        Instances of things like "NULL-terminated string" were changed to
        "null-terminated string".

Various pages
    mtk
        Pathnames, structures, arguments, and <header-files> that were
        bold were changed to italics.

Various pages
    mtk
        Instances of the constant "NULL" that were bold-faced were made
        unformatted (which is how most instances of "NULL" were already
        formatted.)

Global changes

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

New pages
---------

rexec.3
    mtk / Justin Pryzby
        This page is taken as is from the FreeBSD 5.4 distribution.
        (Not checked against Linux reality, but likely things are
        the same.)
        See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=336875

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

arch_prctl.2
    mtk
        Updated discussion about lack of prototype in glibc.

execve.2
    mtk
        Improved description of E2BIG error: it relates to the sum
        of the bytes in both environment and argument list.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Clarified parts of the discussion of file leases,
        noting effect of open(O_NONBLOCK), interruption
        by signal handler, or termination by signal in
        lease breaker.  In response to
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339037

stat.2
    mtk / Stefan Br√ºns
        Added LINUX NOTES describing nanosecond timestamps.

frexp.3
    Volker Reichelt / mtk
        Fixed to point out that that frexp() returns a number whose
        *absolute* value is >= 0.5 and < 1.  Amended the example
        program to demonstrate this.

open.2
    mtk / Avery Pennarun
        Add EWOULDBLOCK error for file leases.
        In response to
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339037

putenv.3
    mtk
        Although the glibc implementation returns -1 on error (and some
        other man pages (e.g., the BSDs) also document that value for
        error returns), SUSv3 merely says "non-zero" (and this is
        what manual pages on many implementations also say).

posix_memalign.3
    mtk
        Formerly, the page said that all systems declare memalign() in
        <malloc.h>.  In fact, many declare it in <stdlib.h>.

strtok.3
    mtk
        Almost a complete rewrite after Angelo pointed out
        that the existing page was deficient.

sd.4
    Martin Schulze
        Remove SEE ALSO for nonexistent scsi.4.

proc.5
    mtk
        Updated discussion of /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max.

signal.7
    mtk
        Added pthreads.7 to SEE ALSO.

Global changes
--------------

Most pages
    mtk
        There was a major reworking of the CONFORMING TO sections
        in most manual pages.

        * generally try to rationalize the names used for standards.
          The preferred names are now documented as the head words
          of the list in standards(7).  For the future: there is
          probably no need to talk about anything more than
          C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001 (or later), xBSD, and SVr4.
          (In particular, I've eliminated most references to XPG
          and SVID, replacing them with references to SUS or SVr4.)

        * eliminate discussion of errors that can occur on other
          systems.  This information exists only patchily in the
          manual pages, is probably of limited use, is hard to maintain,
          and was in some cases simply wrong (and probably always was).

        * Tried to ensure that those interfaces specified in C99 or
          POSIX.1-2001 are marked as such in their manual pages.

intro.1
intro.2
intro.3
intro.4

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several

rtc.4
    David Brownell

        Update the RTC man page to reflect the new RTC class framework:

        - Generalize ... it's not just for PC/AT style RTCs, and there
          may be more than one RTC per system.

        - Not all RTCs expose the same feature set as PC/AT ones; most
          of these ioctls will be rejected by some RTCs.

        - Be explicit about when {A,P}IE_{ON,OFF} calls are needed.

        - Describe the parameter to the get/set epoch request; correct
          the description of the get/set frequency parameter.

        - Document RTC_WKALM_{RD,SET}, which don't need AIE_{ON,OFF} and
          which support longer alarm periods.

        - Hey, not all system clock implementations count timer irqs any
          more now that the new RT-derived clock support is merging.

places.  (Special thanks to Nicolas FranÁois!)


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    mtk
        Since 2.6.20, access() honors the MS_NOEXEC mount flag.
    Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto / mtk
        Improve ENOENT description.

clone.2
    mtk
        Added some detail to the prototype.
        Added some notes on IA-64's clone2().

epoll_ctl.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that EPOLLRDHUP appeared in kernel 2.6.17.

faccessat.2
    Justin Pryzby
        Various fixes as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411177
        * s/effective/real/ in description text.
        * added <fcntl.h> to synopsis.
        * various other changes.

getrlimit.2
    mtk / Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Added a few words to note that RLIMIT_NPROC is really a limit on
        threads.

io_cancel.2
io_destroy.2
io_getevents.2
io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s%linux/aio.h%libaio.h% in SYNOPSIS.
        Changed return type from "long" to "int".

mbind.2
    Samuel Thibault / mtk
        Fix EINVAL description.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411777

mincore.2
    Nick Piggin
        Kernel 2.6.21 fixes several earlier bugs in mincore().
    Nick Pollitt
        Remove words "of a file" -- mincore() is describing
        memory residence information, not properties of a file.
    mtk
        Rewrote various parts to make the page clearer.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Rewrote and reorganized various parts to be clearer.
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Removed text stating that mmap() never returns 0; that's
        not true.

mount.2
    mtk / Val Henson
        Document MS_RELATIME, new in Linux 2.6.20.

open.2
    Andre Majorel / mtk
        On Linux, the error returned when opening a large file on a
        32-bit system is actually EFBIG, not EOVERFLOW.

posix_fadvise.2
    P·draig Brady
        Fix RETURN VALUE description: returns error number of failure.

rename.2
    mtk / Timo Sirainen
        Various improvements to DESCRIPTION.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=416012

semop.2
    mtk
        If sops contains multiple operations, then these are performed
        in array order.  All Unix systems that I know of do this,
        and some Linux applications depend on this behavior.  SUSv3
        made no explicit statement here, but SUSv4 will explicitly
        require this behavior.
        Small rewording of explanation of "atomically".

signal.2
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix incorrect argument name in DESCRIPTION.
    mtk
        Small wording improvement.

socket.2
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Add reference to ipv6.7 page.

socketcall.2
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix .TH line.

splice.2
    Benjamin Gilbert
        Fix inconsistent argument names in SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION.

statvfs.2
    mtk
        Small wording clarification.

symlink.2
    mtk / Nicolas FranÁois
        Removed cryptic text under CONFORMING to referring to
        "open(2) and NFS".  There is no relevant text in open.2 as
        far as I (mtk) can see.

time.2
    mtk / Reuben Thomas
        Remove sentence "gettimeofday() obsoleting time() on 4.3BSD".
        This information is old, and probably no longer relevant.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=403888

write.2
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified discussion of /count == 0/ case.

ptrace.2
    Chuck Ebbert
        When the parent receives an event with PTRACE_EVENT_* set,
        the child is not in the normal signal delivery path.  This
        means the parent cannot do ptrace(PTRACE_CONT) with a signal
        or ptrace(PTRACE_KILL).  kill() with a SIGKILL signal can be
        used instead to kill the child process after receiving one
        of these messages.

sched_setaffinity.2
    mtk
        Fix glibc version number in description of 'cpusetsize' argument.

vfork.2
    mtk
        Stripped some excess/outdated text from the BUGS section.

basename.3
    mtk / Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto
        Add text to clarify that the pointer returned by these
        functions may be into some part of 'path'.

dlopen.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
    + Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" to example program.

fclose.3
    mtk
        Complete rewrite.  The existing page was hard to read,
        and the RETURN VALUE description seems to be wrong.

getopt.3
    mtk
        Added getopt() example program.
    mtk
        Add a few words to clarify the operation of the GNU-specific
        double-colon feature, which allows options to have optional
        arguments.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=352139

glob.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix PROTOTYPE.

inet_network.3
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified description of inet_network().

log.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix .TH line.

log10.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix .TH line.

malloc.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Small rewording to mention calloc().

posix_openpt.3
    MartÌn Ferrari
        Fix return type in SYNOPSIS; as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400971
        Needs _XOPEN_SOURCE == 600; as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400975
    Julien BLACHE
        s/ptsname/posix_openpt/ in RETURN VALUE

re_comp.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Add "#define _REGEX_RE_COMP" to SYNOPSIS.

regex.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix .TH line.

termios.3
    mtk
        Added .SS headers to give some structure to this page; and a small
        amount of reordering.
    mtk
        Added a section on canonical and non-canonical mode.
    mtk
        Enhanced the discussion of "raw" mode for cfmakeraw().
    mtk
        Document CMSPAR.
    mtk
        Make description of PARODD a little clearer.
    Reuben Thomas
        Add SEE ALSO link to tty_ioctl.4
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO link to console_ioctl.4

ualarm.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

usleep.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s/curses/ncurses/ under SEE ALSO

bootparam.7
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Documented "mem=nopentium".

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        The default treatment of _POSIX_C_SOURCE changed in glibc 2.4.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Justin Pryzby
        Added some text warning that the "__" macros that
        <features.h> defines internally should never be
        directly defined by programs.
    mtk, based on notes by Jakub Jelinek
        Document _FORTIFY_SOURCE
        (See http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html )
    mtk
        Document _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE.

mdoc.7
    mtk / Nicolas FranÁois
        Remove CONFIGURATION section, since this does not seem to be
        true for Linux.

svipc.7
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix data types in associated data structures;
        remove nonexistent semzcnt and semncnt fields.

time.7
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.20, the software clock can also be 300 HZ.

        Bug filed (http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408)

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.50 ====================

Released: 2007-05-21

Contributors
------------

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Andreas Halter <halter@google.com>
Laird Shaw <netocrat@dodo.com.au>
Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

Apologies if I missed anyone!

Removed pages (!)
-----------------

Most Section 1 man pages are removed
    mtk (with help from Mike Frysinger, Laird Shaw, Andreas Halter)
        Once upon time Andries added a number of Section 1 manual pages
        to man-pages.  However, since that time, those pages have not
        seen much maintenance, and are not in fact distributed in most
        distributions.  Instead most distributions supply the
        coreutils versions of these pages, which are currently
        maintained.  In addition, man-pages provides the 1p pages,
        which document the portable subset of functionality of these
        commands.  Since the man1 pages are mostly unneeded, and
        out of date, I'm removing them.  The following pages disappear:

            chgrp.1
            chmod.1
            chown.1
            cp.1
            dd.1
            df.1
            diff.1
            dir.1
            dircolors.1
            du.1
            install.1
            ln.1
            ls.1
            mkdir.1
            mkfifo.1
            mknod.1
            mv.1
            rm.1
            rmdir.1
            touch.1
            vdir.1

        The following Section 1 pages will be kept:

            intro.1
            ldd.1
            time.1

--------------

Various pages

        Some .SH header lines were made into .SS lines.  (One of the aims
        here is to reduce the number of non-standard .SH lines.)

Various pages
    mtk
        Change title .SH sections named "NOTE" to "NOTES", in some cases
        also changing the location of the section within the page.
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Commented out .SH AUTHOR sections; the right place for
        documentation authorship sections is usually comments at the
        top of the page source.

Various pages
    mtk
        Changed .SH HISTORY to .SH VERSIONS.
        Reason: in many cases, HISTORY was being used to describe
        Linux/glibc version information, as was already done for
        VERSIONS sections in other pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Removed HISTORY section, or moved it as a subsection or paragraphs
        under another section e.g., NOTES.
        Reason: there are too many arbitrary section (.SH) names, and
        a HISTORY section never was consistently used across Linux
        manual pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Moved SEE ALSO section to be last section on the page
        Reason: consistency -- and this is where SEE ALSO should be!

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated GLIBC NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated LINUX NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "AVAILABILITY" sections to "VERSIONS".
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "DIAGNOSTICS" sections to "RETURN VALUE".
        Reason: consistency.

getopt.3
tzselect.8
    mtk
        s/\.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES/.SH ENVIRONMENT/
        Reason: consistency.

tsearch.3
vcs.4
wordexp.3
    mtk
        s/return 0/exit(EXIT_FAILURE)/ in main() of function example
        program.
        Reason: consistency.

mprotect.2
select_tut.2
dlopen.3
getgrent_r.3
getopt.3
getpwent_r.3
hsearch.3
select_tut.2
tsearch.3
    mtk
        Use symbolic constants (EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE) in calls
        to exit().
        Reason: consistency.

access.2
chown.2
lseek.2
open.2
read.2
utmp.5
    mtk
        Renamed RESTRICTIONS section to NOTES, or moved text in a
        RESTRICTIONS section under existing NOTES section.
        Reason: consistency, and reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH)
        names.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

capget.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH FURTHER INFORMATION/.SH NOTES/

dup.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH WARNING/.SH NOTES/

kill.2
    mtk
        Renamed LINUX HISTORY section to LINUX NOTES, and relocated
        within page.

select_tut.2
    mtk
        Relocated example program and made its .SH title "EXAMPLE".

sigaltstack.2
    mtk
        Move code example into its own EXAMPLE section.

sigreturn.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH WARNING/.SH NOTES/

setuid.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH "LINUX-SPECIFIC REMARKS"/.SH LINUX NOTES/

shmget.2
    mtk
        Remove section about effect of fork()/exec()/exit(); shmop.2
        contains the same text, and it only needs to be said once.

shmop.2
    mtk
        Minor rewording under DESCRIPTION.

daemon.3
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

encrypt.3
    mtk
        Removed statement that glibc unconditionally exposes declarations
        of encrypt() and setkey(), since portable applications must
        use <unistd.h> and define _XOPEN_SOURCE to obtain the declarations
        of setkey() and encrypt().  Adjusted example program accordingly.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Slight rewording.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

man.7
    mtk
        Substantial rewrite, revising and extending the discussion
        about desired conventions for writing pages.
        There will be further updates to this page in the next few
        man-pages releases.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.53 ====================

Released: 2007-05-30

    "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines"

        Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

    "But damn it, these man pages are a mess!"


Global changes
--------------

Many many pages
    mtk
        Reordered sections to be more consistent, in some cases renaming
        sections or shifting paragraphs between sections.

man7/*
    mtk
        In various pages in this section, .SH headings were
        converted to .SS.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.54 ====================

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Emmanuel Mogenet <emogenet@google.com>
Michael Berg <michaeljberg@gmail.com>

Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    mtk
        Where there is an instruction in the SYNOPSIS about linking
        or compiling with a certain option, the option is now
        marked up in italics (e.g., "\fI-lm\fP").

Various pages
    mtk
        Added page numbers to page cross references.

A few pages
    mtk
        s/manpage/man page/, for consistency.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


New pages
---------

man-pages.7
    mtk
        A description of the conventions that should be followed
        when writing pages for the man-pages package.

Removed pages
-------------

man1/README
    mtk
        Already deleted most of the man1 pages previously, so
        this doesn't need to stay.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Removed this page since it is out of date, and the proper place
        to go for up-to-date information is http://www.tldp.org/

ksoftirq.9
    mtk
        Reason: this was the only Section 9 page, and it is old
        (Linux 2.4).  The man9 section never took off as an idea, and
        I see little point in keeping a Section 9 with just a single
        old page.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

HOWTOHELP
    mtk
        Moved some material out of here into new man-pages.7.

alloc_hugepages.2
    mtk
        Minor rewrites, eliminating some duplication, and removing
        some outdated text.

epoll_pwait.2
    Michael Berg
        Fix broken link path;
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=425570

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Remove misleading text about setting O_ASYNC when calling
        open(); one must use fcntl() F_SETFL for this task.

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Converted outdated BUGS note about fdatasync() being
        equivalent to fsync() on Linux 2.2 into a NOTES note
        about this historical behavior.

futex.2
    mtk
        Small rewording to fix "fails with the error EWOULDBLOCK"
        rather than "returns EWOULDBLOCK".
        See Red Hat bug 172828.

mprotect.2
    mtk, after an observation by Emmanuel Mogenet
        A much improved example program.
    mtk
        Significant rewrites and additions to description.

        much information, in my opinion.

sched_yield.2
    mtk
        Added ERRORS section.

set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
        Moved text for "Versions and Library Support".

set_tid_address.2
    mtk
        Small rewording in RETURN VALUE section.

sigaction.2
    mtk
        Add EXAMPLE section with a pointer to example in mprotect.2.

        Rewrite and substantial additional text.

exec.3
    mtk
        Minor clarifications for text on execlp() and execvp().  Removed
        FILES section, since it provides no useful additional info.

fenv.3
    mtk
        Moved link instructions from NOTES to SYNOPSIS.
        Added feenableexcept, fedisableexcept, fegetexcept
        to .SH NAME list.

fputwc.3
    mtk
        Added 'putwc' to .SH NAME list.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        s/int/socklen_t/ for type of gethostbyaddr() 'len' argument,
        and add a few more words in NOTES about the type used here.

login.3
    mtk
        Removed remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil; add
        text on that point to SYNOPSIS.

openpty.3
    mtk
        Removed redundant remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil
        since there is text on that point under SYNOPSIS.

sysconf.3
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to getconf(1).

unlocked_stdio.3
    mtk
        Revised .SH NAME section.

ascii.7
    mtk
        Minor rearrangement of order of text.

capabilities.7
    mtk
        s/exec()/execve(2)/ in various places.

complex.7
    mtk
        Changed "atan(1)" to "atan(1.0)" to prevent some versions of
        man2html(1) from mistaking that string as a page cross reference.

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Small restructuring to avoid 'cannot adjust line' from man(1).

ldconfig.8
    mtk
        Removed now very out-of-date sentence about need to link shared
        libraries with -lc.

man.7
    mtk
        Various text was moved out of this page into the new man-pages.7.

mdoc.7
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to new man-pages.7.

mdoc.samples.7
    mtk
        A few changes, hopefully done right, to eliminate some
        errors to stderr when rendering with man(1).

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Shorten a line in table so it fits in 80 columns.
        Minor rewording under BUGS.

tzselect.8
    mtk
        Moved EXIT STATUS section.

        have gone away,

Several pages
    mtk
        Change reference to path_resolution.2 to path_resolution.7.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Moved pages
-----------

path_resolution.2 has been moved to section 7, thus path_resolution.7
    mtk
        Reason: this is an overview page, not one describing as
        a specific system call.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

        Added pointer to Red Hat man-pages bugzilla.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.56 ====================

Released: 2007-06-11

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    mtk
        Removed version numbers in .TH lines.
        Reason: these were only arbitrarily updated, and so impart no
        useful information.  Version information goes into a
        VERSIONS section nowadays, and the date in the .TH line should
        be updated to reflect the date of the last (significant)
        change to the page.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

    Samuel Thibault / mtk
        In Linux 2.6, the 'modify_ldt_ldt_s' structure was renamed
        'user_desc'.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.59 ====================

Released: 2007-06-25

Global changes
--------------

Manual pages are now standardized on American spelling.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences
for more information on the differences.  Formerly, different pages (and
sometimes even a single page!) employed American and British spelling
conventions; best to standardize on one spelling, and American English
is the standard in Computer Science.

New pages
---------

sgetmask.2
    mtk
        A real man page for sgetmask(2) and ssetmask(2).
        (This page replaces a previous link of the same name, which
        linked to signal.2.)

spu_create.2
    Arnd Bergmann with additional work by Eduardo M. Fleury and mtk
        Document the PowerPC SPU spu_create() system call.
        (Originally taken from the kernel source file
        Documentation/filesystems/spufs.txt.)

Removed Pages
-------------

__clone.2
    mtk
        This file was created by accident in 2.61, as a copy of clone.2.
        (it should have been a link to clone.2.)

obsolete.2
    mtk
        Details on this page are covered in syscalls.2 and in
        respective syscall man pages (stat.2, uname.2).

undocumented.2
    mtk
        This page is very out of date, and in any case difficult
        to maintain.  Information about undocumented system calls
        is maintained in the HOWTOHELP file, and probably in other
        places soon.

killpg.3
    mtk
        This rather incomplete page seems unnecessary since there
        is a killpg.2.

    mtk
        Update SYNOPSIS to reflect the fact that fchmod(2) and lchown(2)
        need either "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500" or "#define _BSD_SOURCE".
        Added an example program.

killpg.2
    mtk
        Note that killpg() is actually a library function on Linux.

    mtk
        Added note that glibc mmap() wrapper nowadays invokes mmap2().

mmap2.2
    Ivana Varekova / mtk
        On most platforms the unit for 'offset' is 4096 bytes, not

    mtk
        Make this link point to new sgetmask.2 instead of signal.2.

stat.2
    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that
        have appeared over time.

syscalls.2
    mtk
        A fairly substantial rewrite of this page,
        bringing it up to date with the current
        kernel version, and listing all system calls

    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that

        Add section numbers to function names; remove some functions
        since they are documented.

proc.5
    mtk
        Update/correct text on /proc/malloc.
    mtk, after a note by Pierre Habouzit, and a few comments by Justin Pryzby
        Update description of /proc/PID/stat to match 2.6.21.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=417933

inotify.7
    mtk
        IN_DONT_FOLLOW and IN_ONLYDIR are only available from 2.6.15.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

mq_notify.2
mq_open.2
mq_timedreceive.2
mq_timedsend.2
mq_unlink.2
    mtk
        Fix broken link

setpgid.2
    mtk
        Fairly substantial changes and corrections, including adding
        coverage of all of the interfaces that get/set PGIDs.

syscalls.2
    mtk / aeb
        Various rewordings; clear up some imprecisions.

lgamma.3
    mtk
        Added 'signgam' to SYNOPSIS and NAME line.

strerror.3
    mtk
        Note that the XPG version is provided since glibc 2.3.4.
        The page formerly said that the GNU-specific version
        is provided by default.  That certainly isn't true
        nowadays, since _POSIX_C_SOURCE is set to 200112L by
        default, so that the XSI-compliant version is supplied
        by default.

man-pages.7
    mtk
        Added note pointing to feature_test_macros.7 for a description
        of how feature test macro requirements should be specified in
        manual pages.  Various other minor fixes and changes.

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        Added note about how feature test macros are specified
        in manual pages.
        Many other corrections, improvements, additions, and
        details about differences across glibc versions.

places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Use 'glibc' consistently to refer to GNU C library.

    mtk
        Order errors under ERRORS alphabetically.

Various pages
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Spelling and formatting fixes, as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=439560

intro.2
select.2
fmtmsg.3
getgrent_r.3
envz_add.3
rtime.3
strptime.3
wordexp.3
    Maxime Vaudequin
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" (to declare exit(3)) to example program.


New pages
---------

    mtk
        Description of timeradd(), timersub(), timerclear(),
        timerisset(), timercmp() macros for operating on
        struct timeval.


Removed pages
-------------

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Somehow, over time, material on fdatasync(2) crept into
        fsync.2, and fdatasync also got added to the NAME section
        of fsync.2.  All of the material in fdatasync.2 that was
        not already in fsync.2 has now been moved there, and
        the former page has been removed.
        In place of the content there, is now a link to fsync.2.

clock_gettime.2
clock_settime.2
    mtk

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

Makefile
    Mike Frysinger
        Make the install target of man-pages respect the standard
        "DESTDIR" variable as well as check the exit status of the
        install command so errors aren't ignored.

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" through out the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        removed cautionary note that use of MPOL_F_NODE|MPOL_F_ADDR
        is not supported.  This is no longer true.

        added mmap(2) to SEE ALSO list.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.22, Linux setitimer() now conforms to POSIX.1,
        giving an EINVAL error for a non-canonical tv_usec value.

gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        Replace discussion of timer* macros with a pointer
        to new page timeradd.3.

ioctl_list.2

        Fixed argument type for BLKGETSIZE.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" throughout the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files and shared
            memory regions, including SHM_HUGE regions.

            defined how "empty set of nodes" specified and what this
            means for MPOL_PREFERRED.

            mention what happens if local/target node contains no
            free memory.

            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        added mmap(2), shmget(2), shmat(2) to SEE ALSO list.

mprotect.2
    FranÁois Diakhate
        Add text noting that PROT_WRITE may (and on x86 does)

    mtk
        Place SYNOPSIS comments inside C comments (/* ... */).

sched_setaffinity.2
    Samuel Thibault
        Note what thread is affected if 'pid' is specified
        as 0, or as the value returned by getpid().

sched_setscheduler.2
    Carsten Emde
        Add text on real-time features of mainline Linux kernel.

select_tut.2
    mtk
        sync SYNOPSIS with select.2

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" throughout the

        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files.

            free memory.

            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

    mtk
        Improve description of num_threads field under /proc/PID/stat.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        Fix path error (s%proc/sys%proc/sys/kernel%) in mentions of
        /proc/sys/ostype, /proc/sys/osrelease and proc/sys/version.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed things to correct and to clarify in subsection
        "/proc/filesystems" of proc.5:
        - clarify filesystems listing: not only FS compiled
          into the kernel, also FS kernel modules currently loaded
        - add a reference to fs(5)
        - add an explanation for FS marked with "nodev"
        - s/mount(1)/mount(8)/, also corrected in section "SEE ALSO"
        - clarify usage by mount: the current wording may lead to
          think /proc/filesystems is always used by mount when no FS
          is specified. So, usage of "may" which IMHO is more
          appropriate + additional explanations
          In mount(8) we can see:

               If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is
               specified, mount will try to guess the desired type.
               If mount was compiled with the blkid library, the
               guessing is done by this library. Otherwise, mount
               guesses itself by probing the superblock; if that
               does not turn up anything that looks familiar,
               mount will try to read the file /etc/filesystems,
               or, if that does not exist, /proc/filesystems.
               All of the filesystem types listed there will be
               tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev"
               (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs). If /etc/filesystems
               ends in a line with a single * only, mount will
               read /proc/filesystems afterwards.
    Samuel Thibault
        Since linux 2.6.11, /proc/stat has an eighth value for cpu
        lines: stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating
        systems when running in a virtualized environment.

arp.7
        Updated BUGS text referring to jiffies; refer to time.7 instead.

credentials.7
    mtk
        Add words to note that file system ID is Linux specific.

hier.7
    Maxime Vaudequin
        This is some corrections for hier.7:
        - missing period for /media and /mnt
        - /mnt description is not totally correct, it is true for some
          distributions but in others /mnt is used as a temporary FS
          mount point, as it is specified by FHS:
          http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#MNTMOUNTPOINTFORATEMPORARILYMOUNT
        - s/X-Windows/X-Window/ (3 occurrences)
        - section "SEE ALSO": s/mount(1)/mount(8)/

man-pages.7
man.7
mdoc.7
mdoc.samples.7
    mtk / Nicolas FranÁois
        Nowadays tmac.XXX are called XXX.tmac.

pthreads.7
    mtk
        Update text about modern threading implementations
        (NPTL vs LinuxThreads).

socket.7
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen
        Clarify that SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO only have effect for
        socket I/O calls; not for multiplexing system calls like
        select() and poll().

time.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO reference to new timeradd.3.

Global changes

*.1p
*.3p
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen and consultation with Andrew Josey.
        Add a PROLOG section:
            This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
            The Linux implementation of this interface may differ
            (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details
            of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented
            on Linux.

*.0p
*.1p
*.3p
    mtk
        Some formatting fixes, mostly to get rid of unwanted
        spaces before "," in formatted output.

*
*/*
    mtk
        Change all occurrences of my email address in man-pages source
        to my new gmail address.

Many many pages
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed useless use of macros with alternating formatting
        (".IR" instead ".I" which suffices, ".BR" instead ".B", etc.)
        because there is only one element.  For example in ldconfig.8:

            -.BR /sbin/ldconfig
            +.B /sbin/ldconfig

        This is not very important, it only makes the sources more tidy.
        To find these I used:

            egrep '^\.(B[RI]|R[IB]|I[RB]) ([^ ]+|\"[^\"]\+\")$'

        And if you want to make these changes, you can use:

            sed 's/^\(\.[BRI]\)[BRI]\( \([^ ]\+\|\"[^\"]\+\"\)\)$/\1\2/g'

        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.time.tz/2034/

getaddrinfo.3
    mtk
        Clarify discussion of NULL 'hints' argument; other minor rewrites.
    mtk / Sam Varshavchik
        Remove some duplicated text.

malloc.3
    Lasse K‰rkk‰inen / Mike Frysinger / mtk
        Clarify description of realloc() behavior for
        ((size == 0) && (ptr != NULL)).

posix_fallocate.3
    Samuel Thibault
        s/stdlib.h/fcntl.h/ in SYNOPSIS.

proc.5
    Fernando Luis V·zquez Cao
        Update /proc/[number]/cmdline description.
        It used to be true that the command line arguments were
        not accessible when the process had been swapped out.
        In ancient kernels (circa 2.0.*) the problem was that the
        kernel relied on get_phys_addr to access the user space buffer,
        which stopped working as soon as the process was swapped out.
        Recent kernels use get_user_pages for the same purpose and thus
        they should not have that limitation.

epoll.7
    Davide Libenzi / mtk
        Clarify the somewhat unintuitive behavior that occurs if a file
        descriptor in an epoll set is closed while other file descriptors
        referring to the same underlying open file description remain
        open.
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/596462/.
    mtk
        Clarify error that occurs if we add an epoll fd to its own set.
    mtk
        A few minor rewordings.
    mtk, after a note by Chris Heath
        Rework Q1/A1, describing what happens when adding the same
        file descriptor twice to an epoll set, and when adding duplicate
        file descriptors to the same epoll set.
    Heikki Orsila / mtk / Davide Libenzi
        Clarify Q9/A9 to discuss packet/token-oriented files.
    mtk, after comments by Davide Libenzi and Chris Heath
        Added Q0/A0, making explicit that the key for items in an epoll
        set is [file descriptor, open file description].
    mtk, after a note by Ron Burk
        Change A3, to note that when events are available,
        the epoll file descriptor will indicate as being readable.
    mtk
        Add some further explanation to Q5/A5 about why an epoll file
        descriptor cannot be passed across a Unix domain socket.

posixoptions.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO entry for standards(7).

regex.7
    mtk
        Add grep(1) to SEE ALSO.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=348552.

standards.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO entry for posixoptions(7).

time.7
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO entry referring to timerfd_create.2.

epoll_wait.2
    mtk
        If the 'sigmask' is NULL, then epoll_pwait() is equivalent
        to epoll_wait().

fork.2
    mtk
        NOTES: since glibc 2.3.3, the glibc NPTL fork() wrapper
        bypasses the fork() system call to invoke clone() with
        flags providing equivalent functionality.

        Minor wording change.

msgctl.2
    mtk

        so make the discussion about group ownership of new files a bit
        more generic.
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: add chown(2) and chmod(2).

poll.2
    mtk

    mtk
        s/posix_madvise (2)/posix_madvise (3)/;
        (The referred-to page still doesn't exist yet, but hopefully
        will do sometime soon.)

ptrace.2
    Anoop, Acked by Roland McGrath.
        Re PTRACE_PEEKUSER: the offsets and data returned might not
        match with the definition of struct user.

shmop.2
    mtk, after a note from Reuben Thomas
        Remove "shmop" from NAME section.

    mtk
        Change description in NAME line ("or" is not correct: these calls
        always change *both* timestamps).
        CONFORMING TO: utimes() is in POSIX.1-2001.
    mtk
        Rename 'buf' argument of utime() to 'times' (like utimes()).
        Clarify explanation of EACCES and EPERM errors.
        Remove BUGS section, since it doesn't seem to add useful
        information.
        Clarified discussion of capabilities, and noted that
        CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE also has a role.
        Other minor rewordings.

wait.2
    mtk, after a note by Justin Pryzby
        Add a sentence clarifying that even though the default disposition
        of SIGCHLD is "ignore", explicitly setting the disposition to
        SIG_IGN results in different treatment of zombies.

aio_cancel.3
aio_error.3
aio_fsync.3
aio_read.3
aio_return.3
aio_suspend.3
aio_write.3
    Kevin O'Gorman <kogorman@csc.calpoly.edu>

backtrace.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        s/backtrace_symbols/backtrace_symbols_fd/ in one sentence.
    mtk
        Fix bogus reference to variable 'strings': should be:
        "the array of pointers".

ctime.3
    mtk
        Add warning under NOTES that asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and
        localtime() may each overwrite the static object returned by any
        of the other calls.
        Other minor edits.

dlopen.3
    mtk
        Add more detail to the description of the fields in the
        structure returned by dladdr().

fexecve.3
    mtk
        Clean up SYNOPSIS after work by cut-and-paste-Pete:
        the necessary header file is <unistd.h> not <sys/time.h>!

        Add documentation of lutimes(), which appeared in glibc 2.6.
    mtk
        Change description in NAME line ("or" is not correct: these calls

        CONFORMING TO: futimes() did not come from 4.2BSD.  (It came from
        FreeBSD; see the FreeBSD man page.)

getenv.3
    mtk
        Noted that caller must not modify returned value string.
        Noted that getenv() is not reentrant: the buffer may be statically

        setenv(), or unsetenv().
        Other minor rewrites.

getgrent.3
    Petter Reinholdtsen
        SEE ALSO: Add getgrouplist(3).

getsubopt.3
    Daniel Burr
        SYNOPSIS: Fix declaration of valuep.

malloc.3
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: Note circumstances in which successful malloc() and
        calloc() can return NULL.

mq_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h>
        is needed for 'mode' constants.

opendir.3
    mtk
        Describe treatment of close-on-exec flag by opendir() and
        fdopendir().

openpty.3
    mtk

raise.3
    mtk / Timothy Baldwin
        Clarify semantics of raise() when called from a multithreaded

    mtk
        Rewrites and additions to various parts of the page.

rand.3
    Tolga Dalman / aeb / mtk
        Remove outdated warning in NOTES; encourage the use of
        random(3) instead.
    Folkert van Heusden
        Clarify wording describing range of values returned by rand().

random.3
    aeb / mtk / Tolga Dalman
        Recommend use or random_r(3) for multithreaded applications
        that need independent, reproducible sequences of random numbers.

        Move references to "The Art of Computer Programming" and
        "Numerical Recipes", formerly in rand(3), to this page.

        Add drand48(93) to SEE ALSO list.

regex.3
    Heikki Orsila
        Clarify description of 'rm_eo' field.

sem_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
        needed for 'mode' constants.

sem_post.3
    mtk
        Added pointer to example in sem_wait(3).

sem_close.3
sem_destroy.3
sem_getvalue.3
sem_init.3

    mtk, after a note from Marty Leisner
        Add text to SYNOPSIS noting the need to link with "-lrt" or
        "-pthread".

setenv.3
    mtk
        setenv() copies 'name' and 'value' (contrast with putenv()).
        unsetenv() of a nonexistent variable does nothing and is
        considered successful.
        Noted that setenv() and unsetenv() need not be reentrant.

shm_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
        needed for 'mode' constants.

undocumented.3
    mtk
        initstate_r(3), setkey_r(3), setstate_r(3) are now documented.

utmp.5
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Small rewording.

resolv.conf.5
    Nicolas FranÁois
        gethostname() is in Section 2, not section 3.

ascii.7
    Stuart Brady
        Fix rendering of ' (backtick) and apostrophe (') in tables

charsets.7
    Nicolas FranÁois
        s/unicode.com/unicode.org/

credentials.7
    mtk
        NOTES: Pthreads requires that all threads share the same UIDs and
        GIDs.  But the Linux kernel maintains separate UIDs and GIDs for
        every thread.  NPTL does some work to ensure that credential
        changes by any thread are carried through to all POSIX threads in
        a process.
    mtk
        sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) can be used to determine the number of

==================== Changes in man-pages-3.00 ====================

Released: 2008-06-12, Konolfingen


Contributors
------------

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Andries Brouwer <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>
Stuart Brady <sdbrady@ntlworld.com>

Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

The POSIX.1 man pages (sections 0p, 1p, 3p) have been moved out
of this package into the separate man-pages-posix package.
This made sense because those pages are seldom changed (only formatting
fixes, etc.) so that it was unnecessary to redistribute them with each
man-pages release.


console_codes.4
random.4
dir_colors.5
proc.5
glob.7
    Stuart Brady
        s/`/\`/ for backquotes used in command substitution, for
        proper rendering in UTF-8.

Various pages
    mtk, after a note from Stuart Brady
        Using /'x'/ to denote a character (string) renders poorly in
        UTF-8, where the two ' characters render as closing single
        quotes.  On the other hand, using /`x'/ renders nicely on UTF-8,
        where proper opening and closing single quotes are produced by
        groff(1), but looks ugly when rendered in ASCII.  Using the
        sequence /\\aqx\\aq/ produces a reasonable rendering ('\\aq'
        is a vertical "apostrophe quote") in both UTF-8 and ASCII.
        So that change is made in a number of pages.
        See also http://www.cl.cal.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html.

Various pages
    mtk
        Replace form /`string'/ by /"string"/, since the former renders
        poorly in ASCII.

termios.3
console_codes.4
tty_ioctl.4
termcap.5
charsets.7
    mtk
        Control character names (^X) are written boldface, without
        quotes.

printf.3
scanf.3
proc.5
glob.7
regex.7
    mtk
        Various edits to try and bring some consistency to the use of
        quotes.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

tty_ioctl.4
    mtk
        Small rewordings in description of packet mode.

locale.7
    mtk
        Minor formatting fixes.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

acct.2
    mtk
        Add a few more words to DESCRIPTION.
        NOTES: Add pointer to acct(5).

alarm.2
    Alain Portal
        s/process/calling process/ so as to say that the alarm signal is
        delivered to the calling process.

brk.2
    Yao Zhao / mtk
        Clarify discussion of return value of sbrk().
    mtk
        DESCRIPTION: Add some sentences giving an overview of these
        interfaces.
        Add note recommending use of malloc(3).
        Change name of brk() argument to the simpler 'addr'.
        Add "(void *)" cast to "-1" for error return of sbrk().
        Removed some incorrect text about "brk(0)".
        Note that SUSv2 specified the return value of sbrk().
        Added a detail on the glibc brk() wrapper.
        Remove discussions of old standards (C89 and POSIX.1-1990);
        CONFORMING TO already discusses the situation with respect
        to more recent standards.

chmod.2
    mtk
        Clarify description of chmod() and fchmod().
        Add further detail on S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_ISVTX permissions.
        Reformat list of permissions bits.

chown.2
    mtk
        Describe rules governing ownership of new files (bsdgroups
        versus sysvgroups, and the effect of the parent directory's
        set-group-ID permission bit).

chroot.2
    Alain Portal
        Clarify description a little.
        s/changes the root directory/
          changes the root directory of the calling process/

execve.2
    mtk
        Fix text that warns against use of NULL argv and envp.
        Using a NULL envp does in fact seem to be portable (works
        on Solaris and FreeBSD), but the Linux semantics for a NULL
        argv certainly aren't consistent with other implementations.
        See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408.

getdents.2
    mtk, after a note from George Spelvin
        Document d_type field, present since kernel 2.6.4.
        Other minor edits.

getitimer.2

        and usleep() unspecified.
        Linux 2.6.16 removed the MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES ceiling on timer
        values.
        Other minor changes.

io_cancel.2
io_destroy.2
io_getevents.2
io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    mtk, after a note by Masatake YAMOTO and input from Jeff Moyer
        Describe the unconventional error return provided by the
        wrapper function in libaio (and contrast with behavior if
        the system call is invoked via syscall(2)).
        See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ltp/4445/
    Alain Portal / mtk
        Re-order ERRORS and SEE ALSO entries to be alphabetical.

io_getevents.2
    Alain Portal
        Small wording fix.

io_submit.2
    Jeff Moyer
        s/AIO request blocks/AIO control blocks/

mknod.2
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
        (possibly dangling) symbolic link.

nanosleep.2
    mtk, after a report from Stephane Chazelas
        Remove crufty discussion of HZ, and replace with a pointer
        to time(7).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=485636
    mtk, after some discussions with Bart Van Assche and Roman Zippel
        NOTES: describe CLOCK_REALTIME versus CLOCK_NANOSLEEP
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/696854/
        "nanosleep() uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC, should be CLOCK_REALTIME?"
    mtk
        Replace mentions of "process' by "thread".
        NOTES: describe case where clock_nanosleep() can be preferable.
        Some minor rewrites.

open.2
    mtk, after a note from Christoph Hellwig
        NOTES: Note that access mode flags are not single bits,
        and document the Linuxism "access mode 3".
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/653123.

readdir.2
    mtk
        Minor wording fixes.

recv.2
    Alain Portal
        Add comment to 'ee_pad' field in structure definition.

sched_setscheduler.2
    mtk
        Add pointer to discussion of RLIMIT_RTTIME in getrlimit.2.
    mtk, after a note by Andrew Clayton
        Rewrote and restructured various parts of the page for greater
        clarity.
    mtk
        Add more detail to the rules that are applied when an
        unprivileged process with a non-zero RLIMIT_RTPRIO limit
        changes policy and priority.
        SEE ALSO: Add Documentation/scheduler/sched-rt-group.txt

sync_file_range.2
    Pavel Machek
        SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE can block on writes greater than request
        queue size.  For some background, see
        http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/687713/focus=688340

syscalls.2
    mtk
        Added system call history back to version 1.2.
        Fix typo on kernel version for pivot_root().

syslog.2
    WANG Cong
        Document ENOSYS error, which can occur if kernel was built without
        CONFIG_PRINTK.

utime.2
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Clarify description of 'times' array for utimes().

adjtime.3
    mtk
        The longstanding bug that if delta was NULL, olddelta
        didn't return the outstanding clock adjustment, is now fixed
        (since glibc 2.8 + kernel 2.6.26).
        http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug?id=2449
        http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6761

dprintf.3
    mtk
        Note that these functions are included in the next POSIX revision.
        Remove editorial discussion about what the functions should have
        been named.

ftime.3

    mtk
        Improve description or 'hints' and 'res' arguments.
        Add details on numeric strings that can be specified for 'node'.
        Other fairly major restructurings and rewrites to improve
        logical structure and clarity of the page.
        SEE ALSO: Add hostname(7).

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        DESCRIPTION: Add reference to inet_addr(3) for dotted notation.
        SEE ALSO: add inet(3).
    mtk
        Added BUGS section noting that gethostbyname() does not
        recognize hexadecimal components in dotted address strings;
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482973

getmntent.3
    mtk, after Stuart Cunningham pointed out the typo
        Remove statement that LSB deprecates the functions
        "endmntent(), setmntent() [sic] and setmntent()".
        This doesn't seem to be true (I can't find mention of it
        being deprecated in any of the LSB specs).  Rather, LSB simply
        doesn't specify these functions.  (LSB 1.3 had a spec of
        setmntent(), but not getmntent() or endmntent(), and noted
        that having a spec of setmntent() was of little use without
        also having a spec of getmntent().)
        See also https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/lsb-discuss/2006-October/003078.html

getnameinfo.3
    Tolga Dalman
        Remove mention of sa_len field from example code.
        That field is a BSDism not present on Linux.
    mtk
        Various minor changes.

inet.3
    mtk / Stephane Chazelas
        inet_aton() is *not* in POSIX.1.
        Rewrote discussion of why inet_addr() is disfavored.
        SEE ALSO: Add getaddrinfo(3).
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482979.
    mtk, after a note by Stephane Chazelas
        Describe the various address forms supported by inet_aton().
    mtk
        Rewrite description of inet_network().
        Clarify discussion of inet_lnaof(), inet_netof(), and inet_makeaddr().
        Add discussion of Classful Addressing, noting that it is obsolete.
        Added an EXAMPLE program.
    mtk
        Relocate discussion of i386 byte order to NOTES.
        Note that inet_aton() returns an address in network byte order.
        SEE ALSO: Add byteorder(3) and getnameinfo(3).

inet_ntop.3
    mtk
        Remove unneeded header files from SYNOPSIS.

        Make NAME line more precise.
        Move errors to an ERRORS section.
        Add EXAMPLE section pointing to inet_pton(3).

inet_pton.3
    mtk / Stephane Chazelas
        Remove statement that inet_pton() extends inet_ntoa();
        that's not really true, since inet_pton() doesn't support
        all of the string forms that are supported by inet_ntoa().
        SEE ALSO: Add getaddrinfo(3).
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482987.
    mtk
        Describe IPv6 address formats.
        Describe dotted decimal format in more detail.
        Add an example program.
    mtk
        Remove unneeded header files from SYNOPSIS.
        Make NAME line more precise.
        Make description of return value more precise.
        SEE ALSO: Add inet(3).

mkfifo.3
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
        (possibly dangling) symbolic link.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Fix discussion of O_EXCL flag.
        These functions may also fail for any of the errors described

    mtk, after a note from Stephane Chazelas
        Add an ERRORS section documenting at least some of the errors
        that may occur for scanf().
        See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487254.
    mtk, after a note from Stephane Chazelas; review by Stephane Chazelas

strerror.3
    mtk, after a note from Daniele Giacomini
        Modify SYNOPSIS to show protoypes of both versions of strerror_r(),
        and make other small clarifications of the description regarding
        the two versions.

random.4
    George Spelvin (taking time out from his busy Broadway schedule),
    with some tweaks by Matt Mackall and mtk
        Add a Usage subsection that recommends most users to use
        /dev/urandom, and emphasizes parsimonious usage of
        /dev/random.

    mtk, with some suggestions from Bart Van Assche and Thomas Gleixner
        Added some details about where jiffies come into play.
        Added section on high-resolution timers.
        Mentioned a few other time-related interfaces at various
        points in the page.
        See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/697378.

    mtk, plus review by Serge Hallyn and Andrew Morgan
        Add text detailing how CAP_SETPCAP (theoretically) permits -- on
        pre-2.6.25 kernels, and 2.6.25 and later kernels with file
        capabilities disabled -- a thread to change the capability sets
        of another thread.
        Add section describing rules for programmatically adjusting
        thread capability sets.
        Add some words describing purpose of inheritable set.
        Note existence of CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES config option.

    mtk
        Add text noting that if we set the effective flag for one
        file capability, then we must also set the effective flag for all
        other capabilities where the permitted or inheritable bit is set.

        Reword discussion of CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE to be file-system neutral.

man-pages.7
   mtk
       A list of standards in the CONFORMING TO list should be
       terminated by a period.
       The list of pages in a SEE ALSO list should not be

tcp.7
    mtk
        Correct a detail for sysctl_tcp_adv_win_scale.

Changes to individual pages (math functions)
--------------------------------------------

Almost all of the changes in this release relate to math man pages.
Very many changes were made to the math pages, including:

* Fixed feature test macros (FTMs).  Often, the FTM requirements
  for the "float" and "long double" versions of a math function are
  different from the requirements for the "double" version.  Each math
  page now shows the correct FTM requirements for all three versions
  of the function(s) it describes.  This may have required either
  a change to the existing FTM text (if the requirements for the
  "double" function were already described), or the addition of an FTM
  description to a SYNOPSIS where one was not previously present
  (typically because the "double" version of the function does not
  require any FTMs to be defined).
* CONFORMING TO: in many cases, POSIX.1-2001 was not mentioned.
  Where a function is specified in POSIX.1-2001, this is now noted.
  Also, statements about what other standards a function conforms to
  were generally clarified.  (The wording about which functions conformed
  to C99 was previously often done as an add on sentence; now it is made
  part of the first sentence of the CONFORMING TO section, along with
  POSIX.1-2001.)
* RETURN VALUE: in many cases, pages lacked descriptions of the return
  value when the function arguments are special values such as +0, -0,
  NaN (not-a-number), +infinity, -infinity, etc.  This has been fixed.
  I carried out tests on glibc 2.8 to ensure that all of these
  functions match the RETURN VALUE descriptions (and the POSIX.1-2001
  requirements).
* ERRORS: many pages lacked a clear (or indeed any) description of
  how errno is set on error and what exception is raised for each error.
  This has been fixed.  The ERRORS sections are now generally headed up
  as per the POSIX.1 way of doing things, describing Pole / Range /
  Domain errors, as applicable.
  I carried out tests on glibc 2.8 to ensure that all of these
  functions match the ERRORS descriptions.  Deviations from POSIX.1-2001
  requirements have been filed as glibc bug reports, and noted in the
  man pages.  (The pages now describe the situation for ERRORS as at glibc
  2.8; I may eventually try and extend the text with descriptions of
  changes in older versions of glibc.)
  NOTE: one point that has not been covered in any page is the
  circumstances that generate inexact (FE_INEXACT) exceptions.
  (The details for these exceptions are not specified in POSIX.1-2001,
  and I haven't gone looking for the standards that describe the details.)

   mtk
        Added RETURN VALUE section.
        Added ERRORS section; noted that errno is not set; see

scalb.3
    mtk
        Removed the scalbn() and scalbln() material to a separate
        scalbln.3 page.  Reason: scalb() is obsolete; also the

Apologies if I missed anyone!


New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

move_pages.2
    Christoph Lameter, various edits and improvements by mtk
        Documentation of the move_pages() system call.
        This page was formerly part of the numactl package, but really
        belongs in man-pages (since it describes a kernel interface).

clock_getcpuclockid.3
    mtk
        New page documenting the clock_getcpuclockid() library function,
        available since glibc 2.2.

udplite.7
    Gerrit Renker
        Document the Linux implementation of the UDP-Lite protocol,
        new in Linux 2.6.20.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

proc.5
    Christoph Lameter, minor edits and improvements by mtk
        Documentation of the /proc/PID/numa_maps file.
        This material was formerly the numa_maps.5 page in the numactl
        package, but really belongs in man-pages (since it describes
        a kernel interface).


Global changes
--------------

nanosleep.2
inet_ntop.3
inet_pton.3
scanf.3
initrd.4
    mtk
        Fix mis-ordered (.SH) sections.

connect.2
socket.2
rtnetlink.3
arp.7
ddp.7
ip.7
ipv6.7
netlink.7
packet.7
raw.7
rtnetlink.7
socket.7
tcp.7
udp.7
unix.7
x25.7
    mtk
        s/PF_/AF_/ for socket family constants.  Reasons: the AF_ and
        PF_ constants have always had the same values; there never has
        been a protocol family that had more than one address family,
        and POSIX.1-2001 only specifies the AF_* constants.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    mtk
        The floating-point environment is reset to the default
        during an execve().

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Misc cleanup of get_mempolicy(2):
        + mention that any mode flags will be saved with mode.
          I don't bother to document mode flags here because we
          already have a pointer to set_mempolicy(2) for more info
          on memory policy.  mode flags are discussed there.
        + remove some old, obsolete [IMO] NOTES and 'roff comments.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Update the get_mempolicy(2) man page to add in the description of
        the MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED flag, added in 2.6.23.
    mtk
        Document additional EINVAL error that occurs is MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED
        is specified with either MPOL_F_ADDR or MPOL_F_NODE.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks getitimer() and setitimer()
        obsolete.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Fix error conditions, now that the kernel silently ignores
        nodes outside the task's cpuset, as long as one valid node
        remains.

        Now that cpuset man page exists, we can refer to it.  Remove
        stale comment regarding lack thereof.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Add brief discussion of mode flags.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Attempt to clarify discussion of MPOL_DEFAULT.
    mtk
        Fix URI reference for libnuma.

mprotect.2
    mtk / Maxin John
        Remove EFAULT from errors.  Under ENOMEM error, note that
        EFAULT was the error produced in some cases for kernels before
        2.4.19.

msgctl.2
    mtk, after a note from Filippo Santovito
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Fix up the error return for nodemask containing nodes disallowed by
        the process' current cpuset.  Disallowed nodes are now silently ignored,
        as long as the nodemask contains at least one node that is on-line,
        allowed by the process' cpuset and has memory.

        Now that we have a cpuset man page, we can refer to cpusets directly
        in the man page text.

    Lee Schermerhorn
        Another attempt to rationalize description of MPOL_DEFAULT.

        Since ~2.6.25, the system default memory policy is "local allocation".
        MPOL_DEFAULT itself is a request to remove any non-default policy and
        "fall back" to the surrounding context.  Try to say that without delving
        into implementation details.

    Lee Schermerhorn
        Add discussion of mempolicy mode flags to set_mempolicy(2).
        This adds another reason for EINVAL.

setpgid.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks setpgrp() obsolete.

semctl.2
    mtk, after a note from Filippo Santovito
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

shmctl.2
    Filippo Santovito / mtk
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

utime.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks utime() obsolete.
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the POSIX.1-2001 LEGACY
        marking of utimes(), so mention of this point has been
        removed from the page.

vfork.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of vfork().

        CONFORMING TO: According to POSIX.1, the behavior of getcwd()
        is unspecified for the buf==NULL case.
    mtk
        Add an introductory paragraph giving an overview of what these
        functions do.
        Fix error in description of getwd(): it does not truncate the
        pathname; rather, it gives an error if the pathname exceeds
        PATH_MAX bytes.
        Rewrote RETURN VALUE section.
        Add EINVAL ENAMETOOLONG errors for getwd().
        Various other clarifications and wording fixes.
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2001 does not define any errors for
        getwd().
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of getwd().

gethostbyname.3

    mtk
        New links to new getnetent_r.3.

getprotobyname_r.3
getprotobynumber_r.3
    mtk
        New links to new getprotoent_r.3.

getrpcbyname_r.3

    mtk
        New links to new getrpcent_r.3.

getservbyname_r.3
getservbyport_r.3
    mtk
        New links to new getservent_r.3.

numa_maps.5
    mtk
        Link to new numa(7) page, which incorporates the
        /proc/PID/numa_maps description.
        As part of the numactl() package, the /proc/PID/numa_maps
        documentation was in a numa_maps.5 page; this link
        ensures that "man 5 numa_maps" still works.
        (Eventually, we may want to remove this link.)


Global changes
--------------

get_mempolicy.2
mbind.2
move_pages.2
set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
        Add reference to numa(7) for information on library support.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

eventfd.2
    Vijay Kumar
        When an eventfd overflows, select() indicates the file as both
        readable and writable (not as having an exceptional condition).

fcntl.2
    mtk
        F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

getrlimit.2
    mtk
        NOTES: Add text mentioning the shell 'ulimit' (or 'limit')
        built-in command for setting resource limits.

gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks gettimeofday() as obsolete.

link.2
    mtk
        Note kernel version where Linux stopped following symbolic
        links in 'oldpath'; see also http://lwn.net/Articles/294667.
        POSIX.1-2008 makes it implementation-dependent whether or not
        'oldpath' is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.
        Add a reference to linkat(2) for an interface that allows
        precise control of the treatment of symbolic links.

mbind.2
    mtk
        Remove material on library support and numactl; that material
        is now in numactl.7.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Add kernel version numbers for MAP_32BIT.
        Add some details on MAP_32BIT (see http://lwn.net/Articles/294642).

        Added VERSIONS (from kernel 2.6.18) and CONFORMING TO sections.

open.2
    mtk
        O_CLOEXEC is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

socket.2
    mtk
        s/d/domain/ for name of argument.
        Add reference to socket(2) for further information on
        domain, type, and protocol arguments.

utimensat.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 specifies utimensat() and futimens().

dirfd.3
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: Add POSIX.1-2008; other minor changes.

exec.3
    mtk
        Small rewording: "s/returned/failed with/ [an error]".

fmemopen.3
    mtk
        Since glibc 2.7, it is possible to seek past the end of
        a stream created by open_memstream().  Add a BUGS section
        describing the bug in earlier glibc versions.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        Clarify exactly which functions are obsoleted by getnameinfo()
        and getaddrinfo().

getnetent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        In glibc 2.2, the type of the 'net' argument for getnetbyaddr()
        changed from 'long' to 'uint32_t'.
    mtk
        Note that the gethostbyaddr() 'net' argument is in host byte order.
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getnetent_r.3.

getprotoent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getprotoent_r.3.

getrpcent.3
    mtk
        s/rpc/RPC/.
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getrpcent_r.3.

getservent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getservent_r.3.

mkdtemp.3
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: this function is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

mq_notify.3
    Venkatesh Srinivas
        s/sigev_notify_function/sigev_thread_function/
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=494956.

realpath.3
    mtk
        Relocate text for resolved_path==NULL case to DESCRIPTION.
        POSIX.1-2001 leaves the resolved_path==NULL case as
        implementation-defined; POSIX.1-2008 specifies the behavior
        described in this man page.

sem_init.3
    mtk
        POSIX.1-2008 rectifies the POSIX.1-2001 omission, specifying
        that zero is returned by a successful sem_init() call.

core.5
    Mike Bianchi / mtk
        Make the page more helpful to non-programmers by referencing
        the documentation of the shell's 'ulimit' command in the
        discussion of RLIMIT_CORE and RLIMIT_FSIZE.
        SEE ALSO: Add bash(1).
    mtk
        Note that a core dump file can be used in a debugger.

proc.5
    mtk
        Remove /proc/PID/numa_maps material (it is now in numa(7)).

cpuset.7
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: Add numa(7).

inotify.7
    mtk / Li Zefan
         Explain bug that occurred in coalescing identical events in
         kernels before 2.6.25.
         (See commit 1c17d18e3775485bf1e0ce79575eb637a94494a2
         "A potential bug in inotify_user.c" in the 2.6.25 Changelog.)

pthreads.7
    mtk
        Update thread-safe functions list with changes in POSIX.1-2008.
        SEE ALSO: add proc(5).

signal.7
    mtk
        Update list of async-signal-safe functions for POSIX.1-2008.

fcntl.2
    mtk, after a note by Mike Bianchi
        More clearly and consistently describe whether
        or not the third argument to fcntl() is required,
        and what its type should be.
    mtk
        Move description of negative l_len  from NOTES, integrating
        it into the discussion of file locking.
        Minor rewrites of the text on file locking.

getrusage.2
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock(3), clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

ioctl_list.2
    mtk
        Remove old sentence about where to send updates for this page.
        Add more detail on mount options that prevent updates to atime.

sched_setscheduler.2
    Carsten Emde
        Update kernel version numbers relating to real-time support.

stat.2
    H. Peter Anvin
        Note that lstat() will generally not trigger automounter
        action, whereas stat() will.

clock.3
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

clock_getres.3

        sentence mentioning librt from NOTES.

getdate.3
    mtk
        Rewrite description of getdate_r() and integrate into main text
        (rather than describing in NOTES).
        Other parts rewritten for greater clarity.
        Make it clearer in the main text that glibc does not implement %Z;
        remove discussion of that point from NOTES.
        Added an example program.

hsearch.3
    mtk
        Noted that table size as specified by 'nel' is immutable.
        Described differences between hsearch() and hsearch_r().
        Added missing pieces to RETURN VALUE.
        Added a number of new entries under ERRORS.
        NOTES: added some basic advice on sizing the hash table;
        noted that when a table is destroyed, the caller is responsible
        for freeing the buffers pointed to by 'key' and 'data' fields.
        One of the BUGS was fixed in glibc 2.3.
        Rewrote and clarified various other pieces.
        Rename arguments for reentrant functions, using same name as
        glibc headers: s/ret/retval/; s/tab/htab/.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Timothy S. Nelson
        Integrate discussion of reentrant functions into main discussion
        (rather than as a short paragraph at the end).

iconv.3
    Bruno Haible
        Describe "shift sequence" input.

ptsname.3
    sukadev
        Fix return type of ptsname_r() in SYNOPSIS.

readdir.3
    H. Peter Anvin
        s/stat(2)/lstat(2)/ when discussing d_type (since we
        are talking about a case where we might be interested to
        whether the file itself is a symbolic link).

sigsetops.3
    Chris Head, signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger
        Fix typo: s/sigdelset/sigorset/

proc.5
    Mats Wichmann / mtk
        s/\[number]/[pid]/ in file names for /proc/PID files.
        And similar changes for task/[tid] sub-directories.
    mtk / Mats Wichmann
        In the description if /proc/[pid]/environ, remove reference to
        lilo(8)/grub(8) since there seems to be nothing in those pages
        that related to this /proc file.
    Michael Schurter / mtk
        Remove sentence wrongly saying that /proc/meminfo reports
        info in bytes;
        see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=462969
    mtk
        Note that /proc/meminfo reports system-wide memory usage
        statistics.
    Joe Korty
        Document new fields in /proc/interrupts that were added in
        Linux 2.6.24.

unix.7
    Marko Kreen
        Since glibc 2.8, _GNU_SOURCE must be defined in order to get

closedir.3
dirfd.3
readdir.3
rewinddir.3
scandir.3
seekdir.3
telldir.3
    mtk
        Fix 'dir' argument name: should be 'dirp'.
        POSIX.1-2008 and glibc call this argument 'dirp' (consistent
        with the fact that it is a *pointer* to a DIR structure).

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Create a new page for umount() and umount2() by extracting
        existing material from mount.2 page.


New and changed links
---------------------

umount2.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change link to point to new umount.2
            The umount2() material migrated from mount.2 to umount.2


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        _SC_ARG_MAX is no longer necessarily constant
            POSIX.1-2001 says that the values returned by sysconf()
            are constant for the life of the process.
            But the fact that, since Linux 2.6.23, ARG_MAX is settable
            via RLIMIT_STACK means _SC_ARG_MAX is no longer constant,
            since it can change at each execve().
    Michael Kerrisk
        Linux now imposes a floor on the ARG_MAX limit
            Starting with Linux 2.6.23, the ARG_MAX limit became
	    settable via (1/4 of) RLIMIT_STACK.  This broke ABI
	    compatibility if RLIMIT_STACK was set such that ARG_MAX
	    was < 32 pages.  Document the fact that since 2.6.25
	    Linux imposes a floor on ARG_MAX, so that the old limit
	    of 32 pages is guaranteed.

            For some background on the changes to ARG_MAX in
	    kernels 2.6.23 and 2.6.25, see:
                http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5786
                http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10095
                http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/646709/focus=648101,
                checked into 2.6.25 as
	        commit a64e715fc74b1a7dcc5944f848acc38b2c4d4ee2.

            Also some reordering/rewording of the discussion of ARG_MAX.

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note lack of glibc wrapper; caller must use syscall(2)
            Glibc doesn't (and quite probably won't) include a
	    wrapper for this system call.  Therefore, point out that
	    potential callers will need to use syscall(2), and rewrite
	    the RETURN VALUE text to show things as they would be if
	    syscall() is used.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to posix_fallocate(3) for portable interface
            Add a para to start of page that points out that this is the
            low-level, Linux-specific API, and point the reader to
	    posix_fallocate(3) for the portable API.

getdents.2
readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        d_type is currently only supported on ext[234]
            As at kernel 2.6.27, only ext[234] support d_type.
            On other file systems, d_type is always set to DT_UNKNOWN (0).

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        comment out linux_dirent fields with varying location
            The location of the fields after d_name varies according to
            the size of d_name.  We can't properly declare them in C;
            therefore, put those fields inside a comment.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The DT_* constants are defined in <dirent.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove header files from SYNOPSIS
            None of the header files provides what is needed.
            Calls are made via syscall(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        The programmer must define the linux_dirent structure
            Point out that this structure is not defined in glibc headers.
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/dirent/linux_dirent/
            The structure isn't currently defined in glibc headers,
	    and the kernel name of the structure is 'linux_dirent' (as
            was already used in some, but not all, places in this page).

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword/relocate discussion of BSD's historical RLIMIT_OFILE
            The old sentence sat on its own in an odd place, and anyway the
            modern BSDs use the name RLIMIT_NOFILE.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to execve(2) for RLIMIT_STACK's effect on ARG_MAX
            Refer the reader to new text in execve(2) that describes how
            (since Linux 2.6.23) RLIMIT_STACK determines the value of ARG_MAX.

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rusage measures are preserved across execve(2)

mlock.2
    Maxin John
        Add EAGAIN error.

move_pages.2
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Make a detail of EPERM error more precise

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of per-process namespaces
            Describe per-process namespaces, including discussion
            of clone() and unshare CLONE_NEWNS, and /proc/PID/mounts.
    Michael Kerrisk
        List a few other file systems that we may see in /proc/filesystems
            Add some modern file systems to that list (xfs, jfs, ext3,
            reiserfs).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document MS_SILENT (and MS_VERBOSE)

mount.2
umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split umount*() out into a separate page
            The length of this page means that it's becoming difficult
	    to parse which info is specific to mount() versus
	    umount()/umount2(), so split the umount material out into
	    its own page.

pause.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of words "library function"
            This really is a system call.

readdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The programmer must declare the old_linux_dirent structure
            Glibc does not provide a definition of this structure.
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/dirent/old_linux_dirent/
            Nowadays, this is the name of the structure in the
	    kernel sources.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove words "which may change"
            These words are slightly bogus: although the interface
	    is obsolete, for ABI-compatibility reasons, the kernel folk
	    should never be changing this interface.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove header files from SYNOPSIS
            glibc doesn't provide any support for readdir(2),
            so remove these header files (which otherwise suggest
            that glibc does provide the required pieces).

recv.2
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Move kernel version number to first mention to MSG_ERRQUEUE.

semop.2
    Kirill A. Shutemov
        Fix typo in example
            (The '&' before sop in the semop() call is unneeded.)

send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make kernel version for MSG_CONFIRM more precise
            s/2.3+ only/Since Linux 2.3.15/

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to signal(7) for an overview of signals
        Explain semantics of signal disposition during fork() and execve()
        Refer to signal(7) for more details on signal mask.

sigaltstack.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain inheritance of alternate signal stack across fork(2)

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Distinguish per-thread and process-wide signals
            A sentence clarifying that pending signal set is union of
            per-thread and process-wide pending signal sets.

    Michael Kerrisk
        These interfaces have per-thread semantics
            The page was previously fuzzy about whether the these interfaces
            have process-wide or per-thread semantics.  (E.g., now the
            page states that the calling *thread* (not process) is suspended
            until the signal is delivered.)

sigpending.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain effect of fork() and execve() for pending signal set
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain how thread's pending signal set is defined
            The pending set is the union of per-thread pending signals
	    and process-wide pending signals.

sigprocmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain effects of fork() and execve() for signal mask

splice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that SPLICE_F_MOVE is a no-op since kernel 2.6.21

syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail about wrapper functions
            Add a few more details about work generally done by wrapper
            functions.  Note that syscall(2) performs the same steps.

tkill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EINVAL error can also occur for invalid TGID
            The EINVAL error on an invalid TGID for tgkill() was
            not documented; this change documents it.

utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        POSIX.1-2008 revision will likely affect FTMs for futimens()
            Make it clear that the POSIX.1 revision that is likely
            to affect the feature test macro requirements for futimens()
            is POSIX.1-2008.
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Make various wordings a little more precise.
            The times argument point to *an array of* structures, and the
            man-page should say that consistently.

wait4.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        wait3() is a library function layered on wait4().
            On Linux wait3() is a library function implemented on top
            of wait4().  (Knowing this is useful when using strace(2),
            for example.)

atan2.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix error in description of range or return value
            In recent changes to the man page, mtk accidentally changed
            the description of the return value range to -pi/2..pi/2;
            the correct range is -pi..pi.

cmsg.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Add parentheses after macro names.

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify mktime()'s use of tm_isdst
            Describe use of tm_isdst for input to mktime();
            explain how mktime() modifies this field.
            (This field is left unchanged in case of error.)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=500178
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording for ctime_r() and asctime_r() to indicate that
        the buffer must be at least 26 *bytes*.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Minor rewording of mktime() description.

floor.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        floor.3: Fix error in description: s/smallest/largest/

hsearch.3
    AndrÈ Goddard Rosa
        Call hdestroy() after using hash table created by hcreate(),
	for the sake of completeness

mq_getattr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_getattr() and mq_setattr() are layered on mq_getsetattr(2)
            mq_getattr() and mq_setattr() are library functions layered on
            top of the mq_getsetattr(2) system call.
            (This is useful info for users of strace(1).)

mq_receive.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_send() is a library function layered on mq_timedreceive() syscall
             This info is useful for users of strace(1).

mq_send.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_send() is a library function layered on mq_timedsend() syscall
             This info is useful for users of strace(1).

nextafter.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Make description more precise: s/next/largest/

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add getdents(2)
             Because readdir() is implemented on top of getdents(2).

realpath.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that returned pathname is NULL terminated
            Also clarify that null-byte is included in PATH_MAX limit.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite and simplify description of /proc/mounts
            Most of the relevant discussion is now under /proc/PID/mounts;
            all that needs to be here is a mention of the pre-2.4.19
            system-wide namespace situation, and a reference to the
            discussion under /proc/PID/mounts.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of /proc/PID/mounts
            Largely cribbed from existing /proc/mounts discussion, which is
            about to be rewritten.

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mq_notify() to list of lib. functions and syscalls in MQ API

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description in NAME section
        Add mention of sigaltstack(2).
        Describe syscalls that synchronously wait for a signal,
        Give overview of syscalls that block until a signal is caught
        Add overview of interfaces for sending signals.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe semantics w.r.t. fork() and execve()
            Include text describing semantics of fork() and execve() for
            signal dispositions, signal mask, and pending signal set.

            Move the shell session text that demonstrates the use of
            the example program so that it precedes the actual
            example program.  This makes the page consistent with the
            majority of other pages.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Say more about unused epoll_create() 'size' arg
            Supply a little more explanation about why the 'size' argument
            of epoll_create() is nowadays ignored.

eventfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text relating to flags argument
            Remove sentence saying that glibc adds a flags argument
            to the syscall; that was only relevant for the older
            eventfd() system call.
getdents.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Fix text relating to DT_UNKNOWN and 'd_type' support
            Some file systems provide partial support for 'dt_type',
            returning DT_UNKNOWN for cases they don't support.
            Update the discussion of 'd_type' and DT_UNKNOWN to
            support this.

getpeername.2, getsockname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ip(7) and unix(7)

getsockopt.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EINVAL can also occur if 'optval' is invalid
            In some cases, EINVAL can occur if 'optval' is invalid.
            Note this, and point reader to an example in ip(7).
            In response to:
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=216092

inotify_init.2
pipe.2
timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify *_NONBLOCK description
            Make it clear that the NONBLOCK flag sets an attribute in the new
            open file description.

sched_yield.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite description in terms of threads
            The text formerly described the operation of sched_yield() in
            terms of processes.  It should be in terms of threads.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add NOTES text on appropriate use of sched_yield()
            Strategic calls to sched_yield() can be used to improve
            performance, but unnecessary use should be avoided.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sa_mask affects the *per-thread* signal mask
            The page didn't previously clearly explain the scope of the
            signal mask that is affected by sa_mask.

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text relating to flags argument
            Remove sentence saying that glibc adds a flags argument
            to the syscall; that was only relevant for the older
            signalfd() system call.

sigprocmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sigprocmask() operates on a per-thread mask
            The first sentence of the page was vague on the scope of the
            attribute changed by sigprocmask().  Reword to make this
            clearer and add a sentence in NOTES to explicitly state that
            the signal mask is a per-thread attribute.

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document SOCK_NONBLOCK and SOCK_CLOEXEC flags
            These flags, specified in the 'type' argument, are supported
            since Linux 2.6.27.

socketpair.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to socket(2) for SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK
            Refer the reader to socket(2) for a description of the SOCK_CLOEXEC
            and SOCK_NONBLOCK flags, which are supported by socketpair() since
            Linux 2.6.27.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add new 2.6.27 system calls
            Add pipe2(), dup3(), epoll_create1(), inotify_init1(),
            eventfd2(), signalfd4().

timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document timerfd_create() TFD_CLOEXEC and TFD_NONBLOCK
            TFD_CLOEXEC and TFD_NONBLOCK are supported since LInux 2.6.27.

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify meaning of "child releases the parent's memory"
            The man page was not explicit about how the memory used by
            the child is released back to the parent.

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        ctime_r() and localtime_r() need not set 'timezone' and 'daylight'
            The man page already noted that these functions need not set
            'tzname', but things could be clearer: it tzset() is not called,
            then the other two variables also are not set.

            Also, clarify that ctime() does set 'timezone' and 'daylight'.

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH is inspected once, at program start-up
            Make it clear that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is inspected *once*, at
            program start-up.  (Verified from source and by experiment.)

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document binary mode (mode 'b')
            Glibc 2.9 adds support to fmemopen() for binary mode opens.
            Binary mode is specified by inclusion of the letter 'b' in
            the 'mode' argument.

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify error descriptions with some examples
            Clarify the description of some errors by giving examples
            that produce the errors.  (Text added for EAI_SERVICE and
            EAI_SOCKTYPE.)

            Also, add an error case for EAI_BADFLAGS.

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rationalize text on POSIX.1-2001 obsolete interfaces
            POSIX.1 marks gethostbyname(), gethostbyaddr(), and 'h_errno'
            as obsolete.  The man page explained this, but with some
            duplication.  Remove the duplication, and otherwise tidy up
            discussion of this point.

popen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change one-line description in NAME
            s%process I/O%pipe stream to or from a process%
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 'e' (close-on-exec) flag
            glibc 2.9 implements the 'e' flag in 'type', which sets the
            close-on-exec flag on the underlying file descriptor.

raise.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pthread_kill(3)

readdir.3
    Christoph Hellwig
        Fix text relating to DT_UNKNOWN and 'd_type' support
            (This mirrors the previous change to getdents.2)
            Some file systems provide partial support for 'dt_type',
            returning DT_UNKNOWN for cases they don't support.
            Update the discussion of 'd_type' and DT_UNKNOWN to
            support this.

strcpy.3
    Jason Spiro
        Strengthen warning about checking against buffer overruns
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=413940

tty_ioctl.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain capability requirements for TIOCCONS
            Explain capability requirements for TIOCCONS, and describe
            changes in 2.6.10 relating to capabilities.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain capability requirements for various ioctls
            For TIOCSLCKTRMIOS, TIOCSCTTY, TIOCEXCL, explain the exact
            capability that is required (the text formerly just said "root"
            in each case).

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
            Defines the system-wide limit on the number of threads (tasks).

utmp.5
    Pierre Cazenave
        It is just "other" who should not have write perms on utmp
            The page was vague before, saying that utmp should not be
            writable by any user.  This isn't true: it can be, and
            typically is, writable by user and group.

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention epoll_create1() as part of epoll API
            epoll_create1() was added in Linux 2.6.27, and extends the
            functionality of epoll_create().

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention inotify_init1() in overview of API
            Discuss the new inotify_init1() system call in the overview of
            the inotify API.

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Detail EINVAL error for IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP socket option
            In response to:
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=216092

iso_8859-7.7
    Lefteris Dimitroulakis
        Add Drachma, Euro, and Greek Ypogegrammeni
            Also, amend description of characters 0241 and 0242.

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Example shell sessions should have user input boldfaced

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe return value from pthreads functions
            Describe the usual success (0) and failure (non-zero) returns,
            and note that POSIX.1-2001 specifies that pthreads functions
            can never fail with the error EINTR.

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Timeouts make socket interfaces non-restartable
            If setsockopt() is used to set a timeout on a socket(),
            then the various socket interfaces are not automatically
            restarted, even if SA_RESTART is specified when
            establishing the signal handler.  Analogous behavior occurs
            for the "stop signals" case.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add unix(7)

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS
            Drawing heavily on Jakub Jelinek's description in
            http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/2003-11/msg00127.html
            (Subject: [PATCH] Support LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS)
        --inhibit-rpath is ignored for setuid/setgid ld.so
            The --inhibit-rpath option is ignored if ld.so is setuid/setgid
            (not if the executable is setuid/setgid).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_ORIGIN_PATH
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of LD_PROFILE and LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT
            Clarify that LD_PROFILE is pathname or a soname,
            and identify name of profiling output file.
            Fix description of LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT, which wasn't even close to
            the truth.  (But why did it remain unfixed for so many years?)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since version 2.3.5, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_SHOW_AUXV
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder lists of LD_* environment variables alphabetically
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_DEBUG

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_getattr_np.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_tryjoin_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain _np suffix
            Add text to CONFORMING TO explaining that the "_np"
            suffix is because these functions are non-portable.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched_getcpu(3)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add pthread_setaffinity_np(3)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify EINVAL error for cpusetsize < kernel mask size
            For sched_setaffinity(), the EINVAL error that occurs
            if 'cpusetsize' is smaller than the kernel CPU set size only
            occurs with kernels before 2.6.9.

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Child holds parent's memory until execve() or *termination*
            The page was phrased in a few places to describe the child as
            holding the parent's memory until the child does an execve(2)
            or an _exit(2).  The latter case should really be the more
            general process termination (i.e., either _exit(2) or abnormal
            termination).

clock_getres.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID not setabble
            According to POSIX.1-2001, the CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks should be settable, but
            currently they are not.

pthread_attr_setstacksize.3
    Michael Kerrisk, after a report by Karsten Weiss
        EINVAL occurs on some systems if stacksize != page-size
            On MacOS X at least, pthread_attr_setstacksize(3) can fail
            with EINVAL if 'stacksize' is not a multiple of the system
            page size.  Best to mention this so as to aid people writing
            portable programs.

pthread_create.3
    Karsten Weiss
        Fix bug in EXAMPLE program
            The calloc() line should read like this instead:

                tinfo = calloc(num_threads, sizeof(struct thread_info));

pthread_exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: thread group with a dead leader and stop signals
            Document the bug that can occur when a stop signal
            is sent to a thread group whose leader has terminated.
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/611611
            http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=122525468300823&w=2

resolver.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix prototype of dn_expand()
            The 4th argument is "char *", not "unsigned char *".
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504708

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix error handling after accept() in example code
            Simply continuing after an error is in most cases wrong,
            and can lead to infinite loops (e.g., for EMFILE).
            So handle an error by terminating.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504202

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add error handling for epoll_wait() call in example code

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve example code
            Fill in some gaps in example code (variable declarations,
            adding listening socket to epoll set).
            Give variables more meaningful names.
            Other minor changes.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504202

iso_8859-7.7
    Lefteris Dimitroulakis
        Add characters for Drachma and Greek Ypogegrammeni
            Lines for these two characters were added in the previous patch,
            but the actual characters were not included in the 4th column
            of the table.  This fixes that.

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a section describing thread IDs
            In particular, note that in each pthreads function that takes
            a thread ID argument, that ID by definition refers to a thread
            in the same process as the caller.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

CPU_SET.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting CPU_* macros
            This page contains material moved out of sched_setscheduler(2).
            It overwrites a previously existing link file with the same name.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of macros for dynamically allocated CPU sets
            Add descriptions of CPU_ALLOC(), CPU_ALLOC_SIZE(), CPU_FREE(),
            CPU_SET_S(), CPU_CLR_S(), CPU_ISSET_S(), CPU_ZERO_S(),
            CPU_COUNT_S(), CPU_AND_S(), CPU_OR_S(), CPU_XOR_S(), and
            CPU_EQUAL_S().
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add documentation of CPU_COUNT()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of CPU_AND(), CPU_OR, CPU_XOR(), and CPU_EQUAL()
            Plus a few other small clean-ups of the text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various improvements in DESCRIPTION
            After review comments by Bert Wesarg:
            * Explain that cpu_set_t is a bitset, but should be considered
              opaque.
            * A CPU set can be duplicated with memset().
            * Size of a CPU set is rounded up to size of long.
            * CPU_SETSIZE is in bits, but the setsize argument is in bytes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CPU_ALLOC()/CPU_ALLOC_SIZE() bug
            These macros return twice what they should because of thinko
            in glibc 2.8 and earlier.  The bug is fixed for glibc 2.9.
            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7029
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Discuss use of types in "prototypes" for these macros
            The SYNOPSIS shows types for arguments and return values, but
            these are really just suggestions: since the interfaces are
            macros, the compiler won't catch all violations of
            the "type rules".  Warn the reader of this.

pthread_attr_setinheritsched.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page for pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3) and

Global changes
--------------

clone.2
mount.2
unshare.2
proc.5
path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/namespace/mount-point namespace/, as appropriate
            In recent times, a number of other namespace flags have been
            added to clone(2).  As such, it is no longer clear to use
            the generic term "namespace" to refer to the particular
            namespace controlled by CLONE_NEWNS; instead, use the
            term "mount-point namespace".
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/mount-point namespace/mount namespace/
            This is more consistent with the term "mounts namespace"
            used in the 2008 ACM SIGOPS paper, "Virtual servers
            and and checkpoint/restart in mainstream Linux".
            (I avoided the "s", because using the plural strikes me
            as klunky English, and anyway we don't talk about
            the "PIDs namespace" or the "networks namespace", etc..)

connect.2

    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: eliminate mention of the obsolete sysctl(2) interface
            Many pages still mention use of the obsolete sysctl(2) system
            call, or used the term "sysctls"; rewrite these mentions to
            instead be in terms of /proc interfaces.

pthread_tryjoin_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use consistent error-handling function names
            Many older pages use a handle_error() macro to do simple
            error handling from system and library function calls.
            Switch these pages to do similar.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

time.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that some shells have a 'time' built-in command
            Therefore, to access the functionality described on this page,
            it may be necessary to specify the full pathname.

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place list of CLONE_* flags in alphabetical order
            (No content changes.)
fsync.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements for fsync()
            Since glibc 2.8, the fsync() declaration is also exposed if
            _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add note on system-imposed restrictions on CPUs actually used
            After Loic Domaigne's suggestion for pthread_setaffinity_np(3), add
            similar text to this page noting that the system silently
            limits the set of CPUs on which the process actually runs to
            the set of CPUs physically present and the limits imposed by
            cpuset(7).

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Removed discussion of CPU_* macros()
            These macros are now moving to a separate page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to pthread_setaffinity_np(3)
            pthread_setaffinity_np() is preferable for setting
            thread CPU affinity if using the POSIX threads API.

sysctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add prominent warning against using this system call
            This was already stated under NOTES, but make it even more
            prominent by adding a sentence at the start of the DESCRIPTION.

uname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add C comments describing fields in utsname structure

atan2.3
    Stefano Teso
        Fix description of range of function value return
            The range is not [-pi/2, pi/2], but [-pi, pi].

            (mtk: This error was reported by Nicolas Francois, and
            should have been fixed in 3.11, but somewhere along the way,
            the fix got lost.)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=506299

bindresvport.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.8, EPFNOSUPPORT error is now EAFNOSUPPORT
            Glibc switched to using a POSIX-specified error code for
            this error case.

            http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2375

clock_getres.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID not settable
            According to POSIX.1-2001, the CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks should be settable, but
            currently they are not.

getgrnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify and add more detail in RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            This is an analogous change to the change for
            getpwnam.3, made after Andreas Henriksson's report.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504787
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename arguments to getgrnam_r() and getgrgid_r()
            s/gbuf/grp/ and s/gbufp/result/, for consistency
            with POSIX.1 argument names.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504708

getpwnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename arguments to getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r()
            s/pwbuf/pwd/ and s/pwbufp/result/, for consistency
            with POSIX.1 argument names.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify and add more detail in RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504787
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an EXAMPLE program for getpwnam_r()

inet_ntop.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename 'cnt' argument to 'size'
            This is consistent with POSIX.1, and also a more sensible name.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text describing 'size' argument
            (After a suggestion by Vegard Nossum.)
            Also made a few other small rewordings to in the initial
            paragraph.

makecontext.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add text on use of pointer arguments to makecontext()
            Passing pointer arguments to makecontext() is possible,
            but only on some architectures, and with no guarantees
            of portability.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504699

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes after review by Loic Domaigne
            Reviewed-by: Loic Domaigne

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update to reflect new location of CPU_*() documentation
            The CPU_*() macros are now documented in CPU_SET.3;
            update to reflect that fact.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove redundant text relating to CPU sets
            Information about CPU_SETSIZE can be found in CPU_SET.3, so
            remove discussion of it here.

pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
pthread_setschedparam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove text saying that only sched_priority is required by POSIX.1
            Loic Domaigne points out that if a system implements
            SCHED_SPORADIC (which Linux does not), then other
            fields are also specified in sched_param.  The simple
            solution is just to remove that phrase from the man
            page.

pthread_cancel.3
pthread_detach.3
pthread_join.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make text of ESRCH error consistent

pthread_setaffinity_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add text to EINVAL error mentioning cpuset(7)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various improvements after review by LoÔc Domaigne
            Various fix-ups after LoÔc's review.

            Reviewed-by: LoÔc Domaigne

pthread_setschedparam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED is default for inherit scheduler attribute
            In EXAMPLE, note that PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED is the default for
            the inherit scheduler attribute attribute.

syslog.3
    Masanari Iida
        LOG_KERN messages can't be generated from user processes
            Masanari notes that this is an FAQ for logger(1) and that
            Solaris and FreeBSD document this point in syslog(3).
            The glibc info page also hides this comment in its source:

                Internally, there is also LOG_KERN, but LOG_KERN == 0,
                which means if you try to use it here, just selects default.

proc.5
    Ivana Varekova
        Fix reference to kernel source file
            Use relative reference to Documentation/mtrr.txt.

arp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers for /proc interfaces

cpuset.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add CPU_SET(3)

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version that added epoll support

icmp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers to /proc file descriptions

inotify.7
    Vegard Nossum
        Fix description of max_user_watches
            It seems that inotify(7) is wrong here:

            "/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
                This specifies a limit on the number of watches that can be
                associated with each inotify instance."

            On my system, the default value for this variable is 8192. But I
            cannot create more than 8192 watches in total for the same UID
            even when they are on different inotify instances. So I suggest
            to rephrase this as: "This specifies an upper limit on the
            number of watches that can be created per real user ID."

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder socket options alphabetically
    Michael Kerrisk
        Added kernel version numbers for IP_* socket options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate kernel version information for IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers for /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_* files
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of kernel header from description of IP_RECVERR
            Looks like glibc has had this definition since about version 2.1.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate kernel version information for ip_mreqn structure
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate info about Linux-specific sockopts to NOTES
            Also add some source comments about non-standard Linux-specific
            options that are not yet documented.

netlink.7
    Vegard Nossum
        Fix incorrect variable names in example code
            s/snl/sa/ * 2

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add section on cancellation points
            This section includes a list of the functions that must and
            may be cancellation points.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework, and fix small error in, thread-safe function list
            Integrate the changes that occurred in POSIX.1-2008 into the
            main list (to be consistent with the list, elsewhere on this
            page, of functions that are cancellation points).

            Also, fix an error that said that strerror() was added to
            the list in POSIX.1-2008.  It was strsignal() that was
            added.  (strerror() was already in the list in POSIX.1-2001.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Tweak text on sigpause() cancellation point
            In POSIX.1-2009, this function moves from the "must be"
            to the "may be" list.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add ref to signal(7) for further info on use of real-time signals
            signal(7) provides some further details on the use of real-time
            signals by the two Linux threading implementations.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pthread_attr_init() and pthread_cancel()

tcp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update description of tcp_rmem defaults for Linux 2.6
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers for TCP_* socket options
            Note kernel version were each socket option first appeared.
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that tcp_mem measures in units of the system page size
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update tcp_frto description for 2.6.22 changes
            Linux 2.6.22 added a mode value 2 ("Enable SACK-enhanced
            F-RTO if flow uses SACK").
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix alphabetical order in /proc file list
            A few entries were slightly out of order.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove obsolete statement about /proc from VERSIONS
            Much of the text has been updated to 2.6.27 or so,
            so this statement no longer applies.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers for each /proc interface

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

_exit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3, the exit() wrapper function invokes exit_group(2)
            This information is useful to users of strace(1).

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details when returned address is truncated
            If the returned address is truncated, the 'addrlen' argument
            indicates the actual size of the address, rather than a count
            of the number of bytes in the truncated buffer.

            Also clarify that if 'addr' argument is NULL, then 'addrlen'
            should is unused, and should also be NULL.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder ERRORS list
            Some errors were listed under a separate "may" heading.
            There's probably no real need to do this; integrate
            those errors into the main list.

exit_group.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that since glibc 2.3, exit(2) invokes exit_group()

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention that glibc provides no wrapper function for futex()

get_thread_area.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc provides no wrapper for this system call

getdomainname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantial rewrite
            Expand description of setdomainname() and getdomainname().
            Note that getdomainname() is implemented as a library function
            in glibc.
            Note limits on size of domain name.
            Reorganize ERRORS list.

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various parts rewritten
            Write a paragraph describing sethostname().

            Clarify differences between glibc's gethostbyname() and
            the kernel gethostbyname() system calls.

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that HOST_NAME_MAX is 64 on Linux
            Also note that in pre-1.0 days, the limit on hostnames
            was 8 bytes.

getpeername.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that returned address may be truncated if buffer is too small

getsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplified version information and moved to a new VERSIONS section

getsockname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that returned address is truncated if buffer is too small

mknod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to makedev(3) to build a device ID

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Loosen language around how 'addr' hint is interpreted
            Mel Gorman reported that in Linux 2.6.27, 'addr' is rounded
            down to a page boundary.

            Before kernel 2.6.26, if 'addr' was taken as a hint, it was
            rounded up to the next page boundary.  Since Linux 2.6.24,
            it is rounded down.  Therefore, loosen the description of
            this point to say that the address is rounded to "a nearby
            page boundary".

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EFBIG error is now EOVERFLOW (since Linux 2.6.24)
            When a 32-bit app opens a file whose size is too big to be
            represented in 31-bits, POSIX.1 specifies the error EOVERFLOW.
            Linux used to give EFBIG for this case, but 2.6.24 fixed this.

            Also, add some text to describe the error scenario in
            more detail.

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc emulation for these calls uses lseek(2)
            (This makes it clearer that the emulated calls are not atomic.)

recv.2
send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make names of "address" and "address length" args more consistent
            Make the names of these arguments more consistent with other
            sockets man pages.

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details when returned address is truncated
            If the recvfrom() returned address is truncated, the 'fromlen'
            argument indicates the actual size of the address, rather than
            a count of the number of bytes in the truncated buffer.

            Also clarify that the 'from' argument can be NULL, in which
            case 'fromlen' should is unused, and should also be NULL.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Internet datagram and netlink sockets support MSG_TRUNC for recv(2)
            Internet datagram (since Linux 2.4.27/2.6.8),
            and netlink (since Linux 2.6.22) sockets support
            the MSG_TRUNC flag for recv(2).

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrote text describing feature test macros requirement for pselect()

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix SHUT_FD* macros in example program
            Add "do {} while (0)"

set_thread_area.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc provides no wrapper for this system call

setfsgid.2
setfsuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify version information and move to a VERSIONS section

setsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework RETURN VALUE section; add an ERRORS section

setup.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate some CONFORMING TO text to VERSIONS and NOTES

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EOVERFLOW error
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to major() and minor() to decompose a device ID

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version numbers for a few system calls
            Some 2.6 system calls were wrongly mentioned as also being
            backported into a 2.4.x kernel.

uname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        DESCRIPTION: Point reader at NOTES for further info on field lengths

atan.3

        Fix return value description
            The correct range for the return value is [-pi/2,pi/2].
            (mtk's fix in the last change to the return value text was
            a botch-up of a (correct) suggestion by Nicolas Francois.)

atexit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        atexit() and on_exit(3) register functions on the same list
    Michael Kerrisk
        Terminating registered function using longjmp() is undefined
            According to POSIX.1, using longjmp() to terminate execution of
            a function registered using atexit() produces undefined results.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Calling exit(3) more than once produces undefined results
            If an exit handler itself calls exit(3), the results are
            undefined (see the POSIX.1-2001 specification of exit(3)).
    Michael Kerrisk
        The same exit handler may be registered multiple times
    Michael Kerrisk
        Calling _exit(2) terminates processing of exit handlers
    Michael Kerrisk
        Terminating registered function using longjmp() is undefined
            According to POSIX.1, using longjmp() to terminate execution of
            a function registered using atexit() produces undefined results.

bindresvport.3
    Mats Wichmann
        SYNOPSIS: s/\*\*/*/ in prototype
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix errors regarding port used, plus other rewrites
            Glibc's bindresvport() takes no notice of sin->sin_port:
            it always returns an arbitrary reserved port in the
            anonymous range (512-1023).  (Reported by Mats Wichmann.)

            Also:
            * Add EADDRINUSE and EACCES errors.
            * Mention use of getsockname(2).
            * Other minor rewrites and reorderings of the text.
            * Explicitly note that glib's bindresvport() ignores
              sin->sin_port.
            * Change license There's now virtually no text remaining from
              the 1.70 version of this page.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Arg given to registered function is status from *last* call to exit()
            It's a subtle point, but if a registered function itself
            calls exit(3), then subsequent functions that were registered
            with on_exit(3) will see the exit status given to the more
            recent exit(3) call.

            Clean up the $LANGUAGE description, by removing bogus comments

            Maybe you will decide that a more detailed description
            should be left to the gettext(3) documentation, but I
            actually care about the invisible part of the patch more
            since the comments have put me off the track initially
            ($LANGUAGE has nothing to do with setlocale(3) and is
             completely isolated to gettext, as obvious from the
             glibc sources).

        Various minor fixes as per Debian bug 471029
            The relevant pieces of
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471029 are:

              - Delete duplicate subentry for KEYCTL_CHOWN/KEYCTL_SETPERM
                operations in the CAP_SYS_ADMIN entry.  (It feels like that
                capability entry should be converted to a list, but I've
                left it in semicolon-delimited form for now.)

              - Remove text about ENFILE from the text about the
                /proc/sys/fs/file-max limit in the CAP_SYS_ADMIN entry, since
                this is already described in the man pages for the relevant
                ofile-creating system calls.

              - Correct or clarify a few other bits of grammar and such;
                see the diff file itself for details.

gethostid.3

            Also: rewrite some text describing the /etc/hostid file, so that
            this location is referred to just once on the page.

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Source and destination buffers may not overlap for *s*printf()
            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7075

            Some existing code relies on techniques like the following to
            append text to a buffer:

                $ cat s.c
                #include <stdio.h>
                char buf[80] = "not ";
                main()
                {
                    sprintf(buf, "%sfail", buf);
                puts(buf);
                return 0;
                }

                $ cc s.c
                $ ./a.out
                not fail

            However, the standards say the results are undefined if source
            and destination buffers overlap, and with suitable compiler
            options, recent changes can cause unexpected results:

                $ cc -v 2>&1 | grep gcc
                gcc version 4.3.1 20080507 (prerelease) [gcc-4_3-branch revision 135036] (SUSE Linux)
                $ cc -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE -O2 s.c
                $ ./a.out
                fail

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite text describing 'dirent' fields standardized in POSIX.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify text for return value/errno setting for end-of-stream case

nscd.8
    Petr Baudis
        Correct NOTES section on reloading configuration files
            It behaved this way at least since
            "Sun Oct 18 15:02:11 1998 +0000",
            some four months after including the nscd implementation
            in glibc. But there does seem to be a short window between
            glibc-2.1 and glibc-2.1.3 when nscd -i was not available,
            I don't think it's worth muddling the point of the page
            with that, though.

        SEE ALSO: Add getifaddrs(3)

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of fork() semantics
            The page text described the semantics of the initial
            implementation of signalfd().  These were changed early on,
            but the man page wasn't updated.

byteorder.3

        SEE ALSO: add endian(3)

longjmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording re saving/restoring signal mask
    Michael Kerrisk
        siglongjmp() restores signal mask iff 'savesigs' was non-zero
            Note that siglongjmp() restores signal mask if, and only
            if, 'savesigs' argument of sigsetjmp() was non-zero.  (Previous
            text omitted the "and only if".)

setjmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording re saving/restoring signal mask
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify when setjmp() provides BSD vs System V signal mask semantics

strsep.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: explicitly list problems afflicting strsep()
            Previously, the page said this function suffered the same
            problems as strtok(), but in fact strsep() doesn't suffer
            from all of the same problems as strtok(), so explicitly
            list just the problems of strsep() in the strsep.3 page.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to epoll(7) for description of epoll /proc files

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various wording changes to improve clarity and consistency

        Global fix: s/(3)/(2)/ in section number xrefs for timer_*() API
            The POSIX timers API is implemented (mostly) within the kernel,
            so thse interfaces are system calls.  Although there are as yet
            no man pages, when they are added they should be in Section 2,
            not 3.  Therefore fix those pages that currently refer to these
            interfaces as being in Section 3.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

capget.2
    Andi Kleen
        Add some details and relocate a paragraph
            While writing a little program using capset
            I found the capset manpage quite light on crucial
            details and I had to resort to RTFS.

            This patch improves the points I found unclear
            and also moves one misplaced paragraph around.

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move page from Section 3 to Section 2

eventfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc eventfd() supports the use of eventfd2() since version 2.9

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add daemon(3)

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded HAVE_D_TYPE from example program
            Since d_type will always just return DT_UNKNOWN before
            kernel 2.6.4, we don't need to use a conditional for
            determining whether we use this flag.

nanosleep.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocated misplaced BUGS heading

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clean up error checking in example program (no semantic changes)

        Many parts tidied and rewritten
            Remove some redundant text, clarify various pieces,
            tidy example code, etc.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bug fixes + rewrites in example program
            Sebastien pointed out that the first example program
            wrongly thinks it can count signals.
            Also, some further rewrites by mtk.

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Remove discussion SOCK_UUCP
            As time goes on, this sentence becomes less a piece of humor,
            and more a puzzle.

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that open(O_NOATIME) also causes st_atime not to be updated

Various pages
    Kir Kolyshkin
        Trivial punctuation fixes in SEE ALSO
            In SEE ALSO, when a few man pages are referenced, those
            are divided by commas.  Every reference is on a separate
            line, and all lines but the last one should end with
            comma. I spotted one place where there is no comma in
            between references, and mocked up an awk script to find
            similar places:

            for f in man*/*; do
                awk '
                    /^.SH ["]SEE ALSO["]/ {
                        sa=1; print "== " FILENAME " =="; print; next
                    }
                    /^\.(PP|SH)/ {
                        sa=0; no=0; next
                    }
                    /^\.BR/ {
                        if (sa==1) {
                            print;
                            if (no == 1)
                                print "Missing comma in " FILENAME " +" FNR-1; no=0
                        }
                    }
                    /^\.BR .*)$/ {
                        if (sa==1)
                            no=1;
                        next
                    }
                    /\.\\"/ {next}
                    /.*/ {
                        if (sa==1) {
                            print; next
                        }
                    }
                ' $f;
            done | fgrep 'Missing comma'

            This patch fixes all the places found by the above script.

            Also, there is an extra dot at the end of uri.7 "SEE ALSO"
            section.  Removed as per man-pages(7) recommendation.

splice.2
    Mark Hills
        ERRORS: Add EINVAL case for file opened O_APPEND
            Target file cannot be opened in append (O_APPEND) mode

            In kernels prior to v2.6.27 splice() to a file in
            append mode is broken, and since that version it is
            disallowed. It is possible this behaviour may change
            in the future; see the kernel commit message
            (efc968d450e013049a662d22727cf132618dcb2f) for more
            information.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Make source layout of 'Link with' text consistent with other pages
            No actual change to formatted output, but this makes the
            page sources more consistent for the purpose of grepping, etc.

mempcpy.3
signbit.3
significand.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: acknowledge FSF in copyright
            These pages are heavily based on original material in
            glibc info pages, but the comments in the source of the pages
            did not acknowledge the FSF copyright on the original material.
            Fix that.

accept.2
read.2
recv.2
send.2
write.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK errors
            For a non-blocking socket, POSIX.1-2001/2008 allow either
            EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK to be returned in cases where a call
            would have blocked.  Although these constants are defined
            with the same value on most Linux architectures (PA-RISC
            is the exception), POSIX.1 does not require them to have
            the same value.  Therefore, a portable application using
            the sockets API should test for both errors when checking
            this case.

            (NB POSIX.1 only mentions EWOULDBLOCK in the context of
            the sockets interfaces.)

            Change made after a note cross-posted on linux-arch@vger,
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.ports.hppa/5615
            and a suggestion for write(2) from Carlos O'Donell

        Add explicit character set encoding to first line of source
            Nowadays mandb has provision to understand a character set
            encoding that is explicitly indicated in the first line
            of the source.  As pointed out by Colin Watson, including
            such an explicit indication on pages encoded in anything
            other than ISO 8859-1 or UTF-8 is useful for man-pages
            that aren't shipped in UTF-8.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519209
            and for some other background (responded to by Colin Watson

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        VERSIONS: glibc support is provided since version 2.10

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of EWOULDBLOCK from discussion of mandatory locking
            In the kernel, the error on encountering a mandatory lock is
            EAGAIN.  Although EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK are the same on
            most Linux architectures, on some they are not, so don't
            mention EWOULDBLOCK as it is misleading.  (Mea culpa.)

getcontext.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of getcontext()

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends POSIX timers API instead of this API

gettimeofday.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends clock_gettime() instead of this API

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note use of 'data' for PTRACE_SYS{CALL,EMU} and PTRACE_*_SINGLESTEP
            These operations use the 'data' argument as a signal number,
            like PTRACE_CONT.

ptrace.2
    Mike Frysinger
        only reference <sys/user.h>
            The kernel no longer installs linux/user.h, so update
            references to sys/user.h.

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add 'iovec' defn to defn of 'msghdr' structure
            The 'msghdr' structure includes a field of type 'iovec',
            so show the definition of that structure in this page.

rename.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make ENOENT description consistent with POSIX.1-2008

timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EINVAL for invalid 'flags' for timer_settime()

truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix description of feature test macro requirements
            After a report by Arvid Norlander.

bcopy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 removes specification of bcopy()

bsd_signal.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sigaction(2) instead of this API

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends strftime(3) instead of these functions

ecvt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sprintf(3) instead of these functions

gcvt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sprintf(3) instead of this function

getcwd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that getcwd() should be used instead of the obsolete getwd()

getgrent.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Returned buffer may be statically allocated and overwritten by
        later calls

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        POSIX.1-2008 recommends getaddrinfo(3) and getnameinfo(3) instead

getnetent_r.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix function name in text: s/getnetbynumber_r/getnetbyaddr_r/
            The SYNOPSIS showed the right function name (getnetbyaddr_r),
            but the text repeatedly used the wrong name (getnetbynumber_r).
            Probably, this was a cut-and-paste error.

getpwent.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Returned buffer may be statically allocated and overwritten by
        later calls

index.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends strchr(3) and strrchr(3) instead

    Nikanth Karthikesan
        Update pointer to documentation in kernel source

makecontext.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends the use of POSIX threads instead

mq_notify.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the POSIX.1-2008 optional EINVAL error
            POSIX.1-2008 allows an optional EINVAL error if
            notification==NULL and the caller is not currently
            registered to receive notifications.

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that EINVAL also occurs of 'len' *equals* zero
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12919

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 specifications for EINVAL error
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12919

        Document handling of size==0 case for posix_memalign()

pthread_exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix error in DESCRIPTION: s/pthread_create/pthread_exit/

realpath.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework resolved_path==NULL discussion w.r.t. POSIX.1-200[18]
            Although the page already mentioned the resolved_path==NULL
            feature, and that this feature was added in POSIX.1-2008, there
            was still some crufty text in BUGS that hadn't been updated to
            reflect the POSIX.1-2008 changes.

            Also, some other minor wording and grammar fixes.

scalb.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends scalbln*(3) instead

seekdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix type of 'offset' argument: s/off_t/long/
            And add a NOTES section pointing out that 'off_t'
            was indeed used in glibc 2.1.1 and earlier.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519230

sem_post.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EOVERFLOW error

shm_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion on name length to exclude terminating NULL byte
            Probably it's clearer to describe the length of the IPC object
            name as a count that excludes the null terminator.

siginterrupt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sigaction() instead

sigset.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note APIs that POSIX.1-2008 recommends instead of these obsolete APIs

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small fix to description of %G
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=516677

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add details on ISO 8601 week-based dates
            ISO 8602 week-based dates are relevant for %G, %g, and %V,
            and the existing details on these dates are a little thin.

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of year from ISO 8601 standard
            The text mentioned the 1988 8601 standard, but there have
            already been two revisions of the standard since then, so
            simply remove mention of the year.

telldir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return type: s/off_t/long/
            And add a NOTES section pointing out that 'off_t'
            was indeed used in glibc 2.1.1 and earlier.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519230

timeradd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that on some systems, <=, >=, == don't work for timercmp()

timeradd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return types of timerisset() and timercmp()

toascii.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note why POSIX.1-2008 marks this function obsolete

console_ioctl.4
    Alan Curry
        Fix 'argp' type for KDGETLED description
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=517485

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that maximum value of 'timeout' option is capped to 30

hier.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of /srv
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=520904

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix type used to declare sin6_port
            The page should use the type specified by POSIX,
            rather than the (equivalent) type used in the kernel

ipv6.7
    Teddy Hogeborn
        Fix types used to declare sin6_family and sin6_port
            The page should use the types specified by POSIX,
            rather than the (equivalent) types used in the kernel.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=517074

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion on name length to exclude terminating NULL byte
            Probably it's clearer to describe the length of the IPC object
            name as a count that excludes the null terminator.

rtld-audit.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that multiple libraries in LD_AUDIT doesn't work
            This is reportedly fixed in glibc 2.10.
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9733

sem_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of length of semaphore names
            Because of the "sem." prefix added by glibc to a semaphore
            name, the limit on the length of the name (excluding the
            terminating null byte) is 251 characters.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite crufty text about number of args in older version of clone()
                Some bit rot had crept in regarding the discussion of the
                number of arguments in older versions of this syscall.
                Simplify the text to just say that Linux 2.4 and earlier
                didn't have ptid, tls, and ctid arguments.

                See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=533868
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version number for CLONE_NEWIPC
            It's 2.6.19, not 2.4.19.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix errors in argument names in text (ptid, ctd)

execve.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Remove erroneous statement that pending signal set is cleared
        on execve(2).

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The kernel source file mandatory.txt is now mandatory-locking.txt
    Michael Kerrisk
        The Documentation/* files are now in Documentation/filesystems

flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded reference to Documentation/mandatory.txt
            Mandatory locks are only implemented by fcntl() locking
    Michael Kerrisk
        The Documentation/* files are now in Documentation/filesystems

fork.2
    Jeff Moyer
        Document fork() behaviour for the Linux native AIO io_context
            It was noted on lkml that the fork behaviour is documented
            for the POSIX AIO calls, but not for the Linux native calls.
            Here is a patch which adds a small blurb that folks will
            hopefully find useful.

            Upon fork(), the child process does not inherit the
            io_context_t data structures returned by io_setup,
            and thus cannot submit further asynchronous I/O or
            reap event completions for said contexts.

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The d_type field is fully supported on Btrfs

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document MS_STRICTATIME, update description of MS_RELATIME
            Starting with Linux 2.6.30, the MS_RELATIME behavior became
            the default, and MS_STRICTATIME is required to obtain the
            traditional semantics.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove EBADF error from ERRORS
            As reported by Motohiro:

            "man poll" describe this error code.

            >ERRORS
            > EBADF  An invalid file descriptor was given in one of the sets.

            but current kernel implementation ignore invalid file descriptor,
            not return EBADF.
            ...

            In the other hand, SUSv3 talk about

            > POLLNVAL
            >  The specified fd value is invalid. This flag is only valid in the
            >  revents member; it shall ignored in the events member.

            and

            > If the value of fd is less than 0, events shall be ignored, and
            > ireevents shall be set to 0 in that entry on return from poll().

            but, no desribe EBADF.
            (see http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/poll.html)

            So, I think the implementation is correct.

            Why don't we remove EBADF description?

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand description of si_utime and si_stime fields of siginfo_t

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve wording of ENOTDIR error

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add preadv() and pwritev(), new in kernel 2.6.30

wait.2
    Gokdeniz Karadag
        Document CLD_DUMPED and CLD_TRAPPED si_code values

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of 'noclose' and 'nochdir' arguments

ffs.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add memchr(3)

fmemopen.3
    Petr Baudis
        Relocate BUGS section to correct position
    Petr Baudis
        NOTES: there is no file descriptor associated with the returned stream
            Alexander Lamaison pointed out that this is not obvious
            from the documentation, citing an example with passing the
            FILE * handle to a function that tries to fstat() its
            fileno() in order to determine the buffer size.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: remove note that these functions are GNU extensions
            That sentence is now redundant, since these functions
            are added in POSIX.1-2008.

lockf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify relationship between fcntl() and lockf() locking

memchr.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add ffs(3)

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        The d_type field is fully supported on Btrfs

setjmp.3
    Mike Frysinger
        Fix typo and clarify RETURN description
            The word "signal" was duplicated in NOTES, and the RETURN
            section refers to setjmp() and sigsetjmp(), and mentions
            longjmp(), but not siglongjmp().

strcmp.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add strverscmp(3)

strcpy.3
    Mark Hills
        SEE ALSO: Add strdup(3)

complex.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add missing header file for example program
    Reimar Dˆffinger
        Fix type used in example code
        man complex (from release 3.18) contains the following code:
            complex z = cexp(I * pi);
        Reading the C99 standard, "complex" is not a valid type,
        and several compilers (Intel ICC, ARM RVCT) will refuse to compile.
        It should be
            double complex z = cexp(I * pi); instead.

environ.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that last element in environ array is NULL
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=528628
    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording fixes

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that mkdir and mount commands here need superuser privilege
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix example showing contents of /dev/mqueue file

standards.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove references to dated books
            Gallmeister and Lewine are rather old books. Probably,
            there are better books to consult nowadays, and anyway,
            this man page isn't intended to be a bibliography.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
pipe.2
tee.2
fmemopen.3
mq_notify.3
qsort.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace use of assert() by code that checks argc
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13569

            As noted by Andrey:
            The purpose of the assert macro, defined in <assert.h>,
            is to provide a tool to check for programming mistakes
            or program logic errors. However, the assert macro must
            never be used to perform checks for run time errors,
            since, with the NDEBUG macro defined, expressions within
            the assert macro invocations are not evaluated/checked
            for, resulting in behavior that was not originally intended.
            ...
            The pages affected in the core package are

            execve(2)
            pipe(2)
            tee(2)
            fmemopen(3)
            mq_notify(3)
            qsort(3)

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ru_inblock and ru_oublock are now implemented
            These fields of the rusage structure are filled in since
            Linux 2.6.22.

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add brief documentation of MAP_HUGETLB
            This flag is new in 2.6.32, and serves a similar
            purpose to the shmget() SHM_HUGETLB flag.

open.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        add some comments on O_SYNC and friends

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording describing of 'nfds' argument.
            reported by: rui rlex <rui.rlex@gmail.com>

semctl.2
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Remove some redundant words

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an explanation of orphaned process groups

splice.2
tee.2
vmsplice.2
    Mark Hills
        Fix return type
            Since glibc 2.7, the return type for these functions
            is ssize_t (formerly it was long).

stat.2
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix small bug in example program
            Since it is a failure, EXIT_FAILURE looks more appropriate
            than EXIT_SUCCESS.

umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc only exposes MNT_DETACH and MNT_EXPIRE since version 2.11
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10092

exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a pointer to explanation of orphaned process groups in setpgid(2)

fflush.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        fflush() discards buffered input

ffs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that ffsl() and ffsll() are GNU extensions

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note nonstandard assumed hints.ai_flags value when hints is NULL
            When hints is NULL, glibc assumes hints.ai_flags is
            AI_V4MAPPED|AI_ADDRCONFIG whereas POSIX says 0.
            According to Ulrich Drepper, glibc's behavior is better.

getmntent.3
    Mike Frysinger
        setmntent() argument is 'filename' not 'fp'
            The description of setmntent() formerly used the wrong
            argument name.

posix_fallocate.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix reference to POSIX.1-2008
            The sentence mentions twice POSIX.1-2001.
            I guess the second one should be POSIX.1-2008.
            This should be checked in the standard.

setenv.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve ERRORS section
            Add ENOMEM error; improve EINVAL description. Also, make
            RETURN VALUE section a little more accurate in its mention
            of errno.

strftime.3
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix error in description: s/Monday/Thursday/

proc.5
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Fix page cross reference
            max_user_watches is better explained in epoll(7) than inotify(7).

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        dmesg is in section 1, not section 8

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        FS UID manipulations affect CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE and CAP_MKNOD
            Nowadays, file system UID manipulations also affect
            CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE (since 2.6.3) and CAP_MKNOD (since 2.6.29).

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version number for CAP_MKNOD in FS UID manipulations
            A recent patch said "since 2.6.29". It should have
            been "since 2.6.30".

capabilities.7
    Nicolas FranÁois
        Reword a bad sentence in description of capability bounding set.

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk

        s/non-/non/
            The tendency in English, as prescribed in style guides like
            Chicago MoS, is toward removing hyphens after prefixes
            like "non-" etc.

        Global fix: Consistently define the Epoch
            All definitions of the Epoch have been refactored to the following:

              1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)

            That form is more consistent, logical, precise, and internationally
            recognizable than the other variants.

            Also, some wording has been altered as well.

            or _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809 exposes the declarations of
            these functions.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update text on nonsetabble CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID clocks
            SUSv3 permits, but does not require CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID to be settable.
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11972.

execve.2
    Colin Watson
        Fix description of treatment of caught signals
            Caught signals reset to their default on an execve() (not
            to being ignored).

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/F_OWNER_GID/F_OWNER_PGRP/
            Peter Zijlstra took the name change I suggested.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document F_[SG]ETOWN_EX; update details on F_SETOWN
            Linux 2.6.32 adds F_SETOWN_EX and F_GETOWN_EX.
            Linux 2.6.12 changed (broke) the former behavior of
            F_SETOWN with respect to threads.

intro.2
intro.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make subsection heading consistent with other intro.? pages
            These pages used "Copyright Terms"; the other intro.? pages
            used "Copyright Conditions". Make these pages like the others.

sendfile.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify behavior when 'offset' is NULL

seteuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note unstandardized behavior for effective ID
            POSIX.1 doesn't require that the effective ID can be changed
            to the same value it currently has (a no-op). The man page
            should note this, since some other implementations
            don't permit it.

setgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix EPERM error description
            s/effective group ID/real group ID/
            This bug lived in man pages for 15 years before Jason
            spotted it! I checked back in Linux 1.0, and the behavior
            was as the fixed man page describes.

setreuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail on POSIX.1 specification for these syscalls

setuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty statement that seteuid() is not in POSIX
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569812

stime.2
strftime.3
tzset.3
zic.8
    Michael Witten
        GMT -> UTC (where appropriate)

sync_file_range.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Add some big warnings re data integrity
            This system call is by design completely unsuitable for any data
            integrity operations.  Make that very clear in the manpage.

CPU_SET.3
    Vlastimil Babka
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return types for CPU_COUNT_*()
            These functions return 'int' not void'.

confstr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix feature test macro requirements

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of 'nochdir' argument.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554819

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document feature test macro requirements for herror() and hstrerror()
            Since glibc 2.8, one of _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE,
            or _GNU_SOURCE is required.

getline.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update to reflect that these functions were standardized in POSIX.1-2008

getnameinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document feature test macros requirements for NI_MAXHOST and NI_MAXSERV
            Since glibc 2.8, one of _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE, or _GNU_SOURCE
            must be defined to obtain these definitions.

getopt.3
    Jonathan Nieder
        Fix feature test macro requirements

memchr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add feature text macro requirements for memrchr()

nextafter.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix notable error in DESCRIPTION.
        "less than y" should be "less than x".

popen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix feature test macro requirements

pthread_attr_setdetachstate.3
pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
pthread_attr_setschedpolicy.3
    Denis Barbier
        Argument name is 'attr' not 'thread'
            The function argument was misnamed in the DESCRIPTION on these
            three pages.

rtnetlink.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes in example code
            Edward reported a problem in the example code, where a variable
            seems to be misnamed. Upon inspection, there seem to be a few
            such instances, and this patch is my best guess at how things
            should look.

sched_getcpu.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place correct header file in SYNOPSIS

sleep.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister
        sleep() puts calling *thread* to sleep (not calling *process*)

sleep.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister
        Add nanosleep(2) to SEE ALSO

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        %z is defined in SUSv3
            So, substitute "GNU" tag in man page by "SU".

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Move 822-compliant date format example to EXAMPLES section
            The RFC 822-compliant date format given in the description
            of `%z' is now moved to the `EXAMPLES' section (note: `EXAMPLE'
            has been renamed `EXAMPLES').

            Furthermore, that format example is now actually
            RFC 822-compliant (using `%y' instead of `%Y') and has been
            qualified as being correct only when in the context of at least
            an English locale. Also, `%T' is used in place of `%H:%M:%S'.

            For completeness, an RFC 2822-compliant format example has been
            similarly added.

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Expand introductory text

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Clarification of %z specifier

string.3
    Mark Hills
        Add stpcpy() to this list of string functions

strptime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Initialize tm structure in example program

undocumented.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove pages now documented
            By now, the following are documented:

                fopencookie(3)
                freeifaddrs(3)
                rawmemchr(3)
                readdir_r(3)
                getutmp(3)
                getutmpx(3)
                utmpxname(3)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554819

group.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/passwd/password/
            The page inconsistently used "passwd" and "password"
            to refer to the same field.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update securebits discussion to use SECBIT_* flags

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200808 defines _ATFILE_SOURCE
            Since glibc 2.10, _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200808 defines _ATFILE_SOURCE

path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add readlink(2) to SEE ALSO
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix NAME line
            The poorly constructed part preceding "\-" causes apropos
            not to be able to find the subject.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=558300

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of SIGUNUSED
            Clarify that this signal really is synonymous with SIGSYS.
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14449

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

migrate_pages.2
    Andi Kleen
        New page documenting migrate_pages(2).
            Andi's text based on the move_pages.2 page;

quotactl.2
    Jan Kara
        Major updates

Global changes
--------------

open.2
sync_file_range.2
umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/filesystem/file system/


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc 2.11 papers over the kernel F_GETOWN bug
            Since version 2.11, glibc works around the kernel limitation for
            process groups IDs < 4096 by implementing F_GETOWN via F_GETOWN_EX.

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes in SEE ALSO

getpriority.2
nice.2
    Francesco Cosoleto
        Move renice from section 8 to section 1

    Mark Hills
        Add ru_maxrss
            See kernel commit 1f10206.

        Description of maintained fields
            These descriptions are taken from NetBSD 5.0's getrusage(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhanced description of various fields

mlock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        /proc/PID/status VmLck shows how much memory a process has locked
            After a note from Tom Swigg, it seems sensible mention VmLck here.

mount.2
    Petr Uzel

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of ppoll() timeout argument
            1. Rename ppoll)(_ argument to "timeout_ts" to distinguish it
               from the poll() argument in the text.
            2. More accurately describe the poll() call that is equivalent
               to ppoll().

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add sync_file_range(2) under SEE ALSO

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct PR_SET_KEEPCAPS description
            The "keep capabilities" flag only affects the treatment of
            permitted capabilities, not effective capabilities.
            Also: other improvements to make the PR_SET_KEEPCAPS text clearer.

select_tut.2

statfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bring statfs struct type declarations closer to glibc reality
    Fang Wenqi
        Add definition EXT4_SUPER_MAGIC = 0xEF53
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document f_frsize field.

statvfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move this page to section 3 (since it's a library call)

swapon.2
    Ivana Hutarova Varekova
        Note effect of CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE on MAX_SWAPFILES
            From 2.6.32, MAX_SWAPFILES is decreased by 1 if the kernel is
            built with CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bring system call list up to date with Linux 2.6.33
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix kernel version number for utimes()

cproj.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note fix for C99 conformance in glibc 2.12.

crypt.3
    Petr Baudis
        Correct note on key portion significance
            As Marcel Moreaux notes:

                The Linux manpage for crypt()[1] contains the following
                statement as the last sentence of the NOTES section:

                    In the SHA implementation the entire key is significant
                    (instead of only the first 8 bytes in MD5).

                It should probably say "DES" where it says "MD5" (and maybe
                "MD5/SHA" where it says "SHA"), because in MD5 password hashing,
                the entire key is significant, not just the first 8 bytes.

            This patch fixes the wording.

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bug fix in example program

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that if 'fn' changes CWD, the results are undefined
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description of fpath argument
            As reported by Pierre Habouzit, 'fpath' is not relative
            to 'dirpath'. It is either relative to the calling process's
            current working directory (if 'dirpath' was relative), or it
            is absolute (if 'dirpath' was absolute).

getaddrinfo.3
    Christian Franke
        Fix a field name mixup: s/ai_family/ai_flags/

getline.3
    Robert Wohlrab
        Remove unneeded check before free()
            The manpage of getline shows an example with an extra NULL pointer
            check before it calls free. This is unneeded according to free(3):

                 If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

            This patch removes the "if" check.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=572508

log.3
log10.3
log2.3
    Jan Engelhardt
        Add cross-references to other-base logarithmic functions

opendir.3
    Petr Baudis
        Specify feature test macro requirements for fdopendir(3)
            Currently, there is no note on the fact that fdopendir() is
            POSIX.2008-only.

openpty.3
    Eric Blake
        Use const as appropriate
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version that added "const" to function arguments
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly note that these functions are not in POSIX

resolver.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix declaration of dn_comp() in SYNOPSIS
            Remove the second 'exp_dn' from the calling signature.

termios.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change NOFLSH text to speak of characters, not signals

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update description of coredump_filter
            Kernel 2.6.24 added MMF_DUMP_ELF_HEADERS.
            Kernel 2.6.28 added MMF_DUMP_HUGETLB_PRIVATE and
            MMF_DUMP_HUGETLB_SHARED.

elf.5
    Daisuke HATAYAMA
        Document PN_XNUM extension
            In linux-2.6.34-rc1, an ELF core extension was added; user-land
            tools manipulating ELF core dump such as gdb and binutils has
            already been modified before; so elf.5 needs to be modified
            accordingly.

            You can follow information on the ELF extension via the LKML post:
            http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/1/3/103
            Date        Mon, 04 Jan 2010 10:06:07 +0900 (JST)
            Subject     ... elf coredump: Add extended numbering support

            This Linux-specific extension was added in kernel 2.6.34.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove EI_BRAND
            As reported by Yuri Kozlov  and confirmed by Mike Frysinger,
            EI_BRAND is not in GABI
            (http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch4.eheader.html)
            It looks to be a BSDism
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove words under '.note': "described below"
            The existing text is broken, because there is
            no '"Note Section" format' describe below. Simplest
            solution is to remove the words "described below".

filesystems.5
    Jeff Barry
        Add discussion of ntfs and ext4

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify description of /proc/sys and /proc/sys/fs
            In the description of these directories, there's no need
            to list all the files and subdirectories that they contain;
            that information is provided by the entries that follow.

services.5
    Yuri Kozlov
        Remove crufty reference to nonexistent BUGS section

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CAP_SYS_RESOURCE and F_SETPIPE_SZ

            /proc/sys/ps/pipe-max-size.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add get_robust_list() info under CAP_SYS_PTRACE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add MADV_HWPOISON under CAP_SYS_ADMIN

signal.7

        Make a clearer statement about nonportable aspect of signal(2)
            Make a clearer statement that signal(2) is less portable for
            establishing a signal handler.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use consistent language to describe read-only socket options

udp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add FIONREAD warning.
            Warn that FIONREAD can't can't distinguish case of a zero-length

            glibc and the kernel.

            (It's an open question whether or not a version of tzfile.5
            should live independently in man-pages. It was added to the
            man-pages set many years ago. For now, I'll follow a
            conservative course that causes least pain to downstream,
            by continuing to maintain a separate copy in man-pages.)

            Various changes to:
            * Update feature test requirements to note changes in
              recent glibc releases
            * Correct errors in feature test macro requirements
            * Add feature test macro requirements to pages where
              the requirements were not previously stated.

            so that readers are pointed to the information that
            feature test macros must be defined before including
            *any* header file.

            Programmers often make the mistake of including a feature test
            macro only after having already included some header files.
            This patch adds some text at opportune places to remind
            programmers to do things the right way.

insque.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Noted prev == NULL bug in glibc 2.4 and earlier
            As noted by Remi Denis-Courmont, glibc nowadays allows
            'prev' to be NULL, as required by POSIX for initializing
            a linear list. But in glibc 2.4 and earlier, 'prev' could
            not be NULL. Add a BUGS section noting this.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=551201

        New page documenting the PowerPC-specific subpage_prot(2)

aio_init.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting aio_init(3)


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the architecture-specific arm_fadvise64_64() system call
            This ARM-specific system call fixes the argument ordering
            for that architecture. Since Linux 2.6.14.

sync_file_range.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the architecture-specific sync_file_range2() system call
            As described in commit edd5cd4a9424f22b0fa08bef5e299d41befd5622,
            the sync_file_range() argument order is broken for some
            architectures (PowerPC, ARM, tile). The remedy was a different
            system call using the right argument order on those architectures.

psignal.3
    Guillem Jover
        Document psiginfo()
            psiginfo() was added to glibc in version 2.10.

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        global fix: s/Unix/UNIX/
            The man pages were rather inconsistent in the use of "Unix"
            versus "UNIX". Let's go with the trademark usage.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

inotify_rm_watch.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: fix type of 'wd' argument

        Add the PowerPC-specific subpage_prot() system call
        Add sync_file_range2()

truncate.2

        SEE ALSO: Add lio_listio(3)

gai_cancel.3
gai_error.3
gai_suspend.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make these into links
            In the previous release, these files were accidentally made copies
            of getaddrinfo_a.3, instead of being made as link files.

getifaddrs.3
    Thomas Jarosch
        Prevent possible NULL pointer access in example program

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Emphasize that malloc() and realloc() do not initialize allocated memory

malloc_hook.3
    Ivana Varekova
        Warn that these functions are deprecated

strcpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Formatting fixes in strncpy() example implementation code

    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword NOTES on Linux-specific options

sigevent.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add aio_read(3), aio_write(3), and lio_listio(3)

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the autobind feature
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of abstract socket names
            As reported by Lennart Poettering:
                The part about "abstract" sockets is misleading as it suggests
                that the sockaddr returned by getsockname() would necessarily
                have the size of sizeof(struct sockaddr), which however is not
                the case: getsockname() returns exactly the sockaddr size that
                was passed in on bind(). In particular, two sockets that are
                bound to the same sockaddr but different sizes are completely
                independent.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19812
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of "pathname" sockets
            As reported by Lennart Poettering:
               The part about "pathname" sockets suggests usage of
               sizeof(sa_family_t) + strlen(sun_path) + 1
               for calculating the sockaddr size. Due to alignment/padding
               this is probably not a good idea. Instead, one should use
               offsetof(struct sockaddr_un, sun_path) + strlen() + 1
               or something like that.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19812

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

kexec_load.2
    Andi Kleen
        New page documenting kexec_load(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add license
    Michael Kerrisk
        Incorporate fixes from Eric W. Biederman
            Eric noted that a few instances of "virtual" should
            be "physical" and noted:

                There is an expectation that at hand off from sys_kexec that
                virtual and physical addresses will be identity mapped. But
                this isn't the old Alpha booting convention where you have
                a virtual address and then you have to parse the page table
                to figure out where your kernel was actually loaded.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Additions and edits by mtk
            Various wording and layout improvements.
            Fixed the name of a constant: s/KEXEC_ARCH_I386/KEXEC_ARCH_386/.
            Added RETURN VALUE and ERRORS sections.
            Added VERSIONS section
            Note that CONFIG_KEXEC is needed
            Removed details of using syscall; the reader can find them in
            syscall(2).
            Added some details for KEXEC_PRESERVE_CONTEXT.
            Revised the text mentioning the kernel header, since it is
            not yet exported, and it's not certain that it will be.

lio_listio.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting lio_listio(3)


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

reboot.2

    Lucian Adrian Grijincu
        Improve description of CLONE_NEWNET
            CLONE_NEWNET creates a new network namespace from scratch.
            You don't have anything from the old network namespace in
            the new one. Even the loopback device is new.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CLONE_SYSVSEM
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CLONE_NEWUTS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN to CLONE_NEWNS section
            And rewrite the EPERM description to be more general in
            preparation for the new flags to be documented.


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to feature_test_macros(7)
            Some pages simply list feature test macro requirements in

                #define #GNU_SOURCE
                #include <someheader.h>

koi8-r.7
    David Prevot
        Fix special character names
            Comparing to koi8-u.7, I noticed some inconsistencies in special
            character names. After checking with the following Unicode related
            pages, please find inline (and gzipped attached, hopefully not
            messing with encoding), a patch in order to make it right, on an
            Unicode point of view.

            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2500.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U25A0.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf
    David Prevot
        Fix SEE ALSO reference and letter names
            The koi8-r(7) (Russian Net Character Set) manual page refers
            to iso-8859-7(7) manual page, which is the Latin/Greek one.
            I guess it should refer instead to the iso-8859-5(7)
            (Latin/Cyrillic) one. This is addressed at the end of the patch.

            It has also been spotted that letter names are different in
            this manual page and in the Unicode related page [0], the
            first part of the page address this.

                    0: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update example
            The old example used the chmod(2) man page, but the
            feature test macro requirements on that page had changed.
            Update to use an example from a different page (acct(2),
            whose feature test macro requirements are probably unlikely
            to change in the future).

            But $PWD won't be expanded in single quotes. It should be double
            quotes around the entire argument or some other form.

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk

err.3
    Seonghun Lim
        Clean up description of error message source
            In the second paragraph of DESCRIPTION section, one of the
            sources of error messages is incorrect: the four functions obtain
            error message only from errno, and "a code" is just relevant
            with errc() and warnc(), which are not present on Linux.
            see http://www.unix.com/man-page/freebsd/3/ERR/ .

            Then, the third paragraph becomes a duplicate.

lockf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mikel Ward]
        ERRORS: EBADF can also occur for nonwritable file descriptor
            As noted in the DESCRIPTION, the file descriptor must be writable
            in order to place a lock.

malloc.3
    Seonghun Lim
        Reorder prototypes in SYNOPSIS
            calloc() comes before realloc() in the other sections,
            so should do in SYNOPSIS, too.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

sendmmsg.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephan Mueller]
        New page for sendmmsg(2)
            Some pieces inspired by an initial attempt by Stephan Mueller.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

fallocate.2
    Lucian Adrian Grijincu
        Document FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
            FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE was added in Linux 2.6.38,
            for punching holes in the allocated space in a file.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

dup.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Add "#include <fcntl.h>" for O_* constants

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantial restructuring of DESCRIPTION
            The addition of a second class of operation ("hole punching")
            to the man page made it clear that some significant restructuring
            is required. So I substantially reworked the page, including the
            preexisting material on the default "file allocation" operation.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josef Bacik]
        Add further details for FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EPERM error case for FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Describe clone() call equivalent to fork()

fsync.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Various improvements
            - explain the situation with disk caches better
            - remove the duplicate fdatasync() explanation in the NOTES
              section
            - remove an incorrect note about fsync() generally requiring two
              writes
            - remove an obsolete ext2 example note
            - fsync() works on any file descriptor (doesn't need to be
              writable); correct the EBADF error code explanation
    Michael Kerrisk  [Guillem Jover]
        Note that some systems require a writable file descriptor
            An edited version of Guillem Jover's comments:
            [While the file descriptor does not need to be writable on Linux]
            that's not a safe portable assumption to make on POSIX in general
            as that behavior is not specified and as such is
            implementation-specific. Some Unix systems do actually fail on
            read-only file descriptors, for example [HP-UX and AIX].

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Junjiro Okajima]
        Removed erroneous statement about MS_RDONLY and bind mounts

open.2
    Jessica McKellar
        Fix grammar in O_DIRECT description
            Some small grammar fixes to the O_DIRECT description.

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Salvo Tomaselli]
        SYNOPSIS: Add "#include <fcntl.h>" for O_* constants
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=659750

sched_rr_get_interval.2
    Clemens Ladisch
        Update notes on modifying quantum
            Since Linux 2.6.24, it is no longer possible to
            modify the SCHED_RR quantum using setpriority(2).
            (Slight edits to Clemens' patch by mtk.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reordered various pieces of text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reworded text of ESRCH error

send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of sendmmsg(2)

sync.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        PROTOTYPE: Fix return type of syncfs()

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight@binnacle.cx]
        Clarify what is duplicated in the child
            Add some words to make it clear to the reader that vfork(),
            like fork(), creates duplicates of process attributes
            in the child.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note clone() flags equivalent to vfork()
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight@binnacle.cx, Mike Frysinger]
        Add some notes on reasons why vfork() still exists
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight@binnacle.cx]
        Clarify that calling *thread* is suspended during vfork()
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: Note that POSIX.1-2001 marked vfork() obsolete

        Document C11 and glibc 2.16 changes affecting gets()

pthread_sigmask.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Pat Pannuto]
        Fix comment that was inconsistent with code in example program

    Walter Harms
        EXAMPLE: Remove extraneous line of output from shell session

wcsnrtombs.3
wcsrtombs.3
wcstombs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix-ups for e9c23bc636426366d659809bc99cd84661e86464

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Junjiro Okajima]
        Document %E specifier for core_pattern

passwd.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Walter Haidinger]
        s/asterisk/asterisk (*)/ to improve clarity
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct note on passwd field value when shadowing is enabled
            When password shadowing is enabled, the password field
            contains an 'x' (not "*').

proc.5
    Elie De Brauwer

            SIgned-off-by: Elie De Brauwer <eliedebrauwer@gmail.com>

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Slaven Rezic]
        Describe syntax used for comments
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=656994

man.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes for description of NAME section
            As noted by reporter:
            * The code sample given for the NAME section is incomplete because
              the actual content sample is not given.
            * Additionally, the description assumes that the item described is
              a command, which need not be the case.
            * The command makewhatis is not present on my system; the
              documented tool to create the whatis database is called mandb.
            * The description on .SH NAME in man(7) should either copy the
              relevant paragraph of lexgrog(1) or refer to it.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

getent.1
    Mark R. Bannister
        New page to document 'getent' binary provided by glibc


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

bdflush.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that bdflush() is deprecated, and does nothing

nfsservctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that this system call was removed in Linux 3.1

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Tejun Heo]
        add extended description of various ptrace quirks
            Changes include:

            s/parent/tracer/g, s/child/tracee/g - ptrace interface now
            is sufficiently cleaned up to not treat tracing process
            as parent.

            Deleted several outright false statements:
            - pid 1 can be traced
            - tracer is not shown as parent in ps output
            - PTRACE_ATTACH is not "the same behavior as if tracee had done
              a PTRACE_TRACEME": PTRACE_ATTACH delivers a SIGSTOP.
            - SIGSTOP _can_ be injected.
            - Removed mentions of SunOS and Solaris as irrelevant.
            - Added a few more known bugs.

            Added a large block of text in DESCRIPTION which doesn't focus
            on mechanical description of each flag and operation, but rather
            tries to describe a bigger picture. The targeted audience is
            a person which is reasonably knowledgeable in Unix but did not
            spend years working with ptrace, and thus may be unaware of its
            quirks. This text went through several iterations of review by
            Oleg Nesterov and Tejun Heo.
            This block of text intentionally uses as little markup as possible,
            otherwise future modifications to it will be very hard to make.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global clean-up of page
            * Wording and formatting fixes to existing text and
              Denys Vlasenko's new text.
            * Various technical amendments and improvements to
              Denys Vlasenko's new text.
            * Added FIXME for various problems with the current text.

        Integrated changes after further review from Denys Vlasenko

    Cyrill Gorcunov
        Document PR_SET_MM (new in Linux 3.3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various edits and improvements to Cyrill's patch


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of 'size' argument
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add .SS for description of epoll_create1()

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Armin Rigo]
        Another thread can add to epoll instance while epoll_wait is blocked
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43072
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that epoll_pwait() blocks calling *thread*
        A few wording improvements

fchmodat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Note difference between glibc wrapper and underlying system call
            The wrapper function has a 'flags' argument (which currently
            serves no purpose), while the underlying system call does not.

fcntl.2
    Abhijith Das
        Explain behaviour of F_GETLEASE during lease break
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        Change type of arg from "long" to "int"
            Various fcntl(2) commands require an integral 'arg'.
            The man page said it must be "long" in all such cases.
            However, for the cases covered by POSIX, there is an
            explicit requirement that these arguments be "int".
            Update the man page to reflect. Probably, all of the
            other "long" cases (not specified in POSIX) should
            be "int", and this patch makes them so. Based on a
            note fromEric Blake, relating to F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC.

gettimeofday.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorganize content
            The main change is to move the historical information about
            the 'tz_dsttime' to NOTES.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Felix]
        Note that compiler issues warnings if 'tv' is NULL

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kevin O'Gorman]
        Clarify that this system call should not be invoked directly
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42892
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify NOTES discussion of mmap() versus mmap2()

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michael Welsh Duggan]
        Document negative value in 'fd' field
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document semantics of passing zero in 'events' field

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        Various fixes
            For some reason, the PTRACE_TRACEME paragraph talks about some
            general aspects of ptraced process behavior. It repeats the
            "tracee stops on every signal" information even though that was
            already explained just a few paragraphs before. Then it describes
            legacy SIGTRAP on execve().

            This patch deletes the first part, and moves the second part up,
            into the general ptrace description. It also adds
            "If PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option is not in effect" to the description
            of the legacy SIGTRAP on execve().

            The patch also amends the part which says "For requests other
            than PTRACE_KILL, the tracee must be stopped." - PTRACE_ATTACH
            also doesn't require that.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Jaeger, ]
        Clarify that the use of SI_SIGIO is for Linux 2.2 only
            See also http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6745

sigprocmask.2
    Mike Frysinger
        ERRORS: add EFAULT

times.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        ERRORS: Add EFAULT

div.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Reuben Thomas]

fread.3
    Regid Ichira
        Clarify further that return value is number of items, not bytes
            See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=665780

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jak]
        Correct type of ai_addrlen field

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add malloc_usable_size(3)
        SEE ALSO: Add malloc_trim(3)

mallopt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix text describing M_PERTURB and free()
        SEE ALSO: Add malloc_trim(3)

memchr.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Reuben Thomas]
        Remove mention of terminating null in description of rawmemchr()

perror.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jesus Otero]
        Note that use of 'sys_errlist' is deprecated

rcmd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc eventually added a declaration of iruserok() in version 2.12

sysconf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ricardo Catalinas Jim√©nez]
        Add mention of _SC_SYMLOOP_MAX

nologin.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tetsuo Handa]
        nologin must not only exist, but *be readable* to be effective

nsswitch.conf.5
    Mark R Bannister
        Significant rewrites and improvements
            This patch applies to nsswitch.conf.5 in man-pages-3.36.

            My changes almost completely rewrite large sections of the
            man page. They are needed to add clarity, correct grammar,
            reduce confusion, and bring up-to-date with the latest glibc.
            I have checked the man page against the nss source code in
            glibc 2.14.90.

            Historical notes are demoted to the footer.

            The rewrite makes the man page much clearer to
            understand, more authoratitive, and easier to read.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Light edits to Mark Bannister's changes

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add prctl(PR_SET_MM) to CAP_SYS_RESOURCE

            See also https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=754611

ld.so.8
    Jonathan Nieder  [Reuben Thomas]
        Document effect of hwcaps on search path
            Wording by Aurelien Jarno from Debian glibc's r4701 (2011-06-04).

        SEE ALSO: Add clock_gettime(2)

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE and PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_ENABLE
            Add some basic documentation of these operations, with a pointer to
            tools/perf/design.txt for more information.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marcel Holtmann]
        Amend details of PR_SET_PDEATHSIG

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Note SPARC deviation with respect to get/set regs
            SPARC reverses the use of 'addr' and 'data' for
            PTRACE_GETREGS, PTRACE_GETFPREGS, PTRACE_SETREGS,
            and PTRACE_SETFPREGS.

send.2
    Stefan Puiu
        Document EACCES error case for UDP

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of raise(3) for SI_USER
            For a long time now, glibc's raise(3) didn't yield SI_USER
            for the signal receiver, so remove mention of raise(3)
            here. The user can deduce the details, if needed, by looking
            at the recently updated raise(3) page.

aio_cancel.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Rewrite RETURN VALUE section to be clearer

aio_init.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Remove extraneous "POSIX" from NAME section

btree.3
dbopen.3
hash.3
mpool.3
recno.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Brian M. Carlson]
        Note that glibc no longer provides these interfaces
            glibc stopped providing these interfaces with v2.2.
            Nowadays, the user that finds these pages probably wants
            the libdb API, so note this in the page.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=337581

fopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Note limitation on number of flag characters parsed in 'mode'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'c' and 'e' flags are ignored for fdopen()
            Determined from reading libio/iofdopen.c.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document ",ccs=string" feature of 'mode' for fopen()/freopen()

getgrnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ulrich Drepper]
        Fix discussion of _SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX
            The value is not meant to be a maximum (as was specified in
            SUSv3) but an initial guess at the required size
            (as specified in SUSv4).

getpwnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ulrich Drepper]
        Fix discussion of _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX
            The value is not meant to be a maximum (as was specified in
            SUSv3) but an initial guess at the required size
            (as specified in SUSv4).

malloc.3
mallopt.3
mtrace.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add mcheck(3)

memchr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description, omitting mention of "strings" and "characters"
            The existing text slipped into talking about characters and
            strings, which could mislead readers into thing that, for
            example, searches for the byte '\0' are treated specially.
            Therefore, rewrite in terms of "bytes" and "memory areas".

            At the same time, make a few source file clean-ups.

mkstemp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "mkstemps" and "mkostemps" to NAME line

posix_openpt.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vadim Mikhailov]
        Add some details on use of the slave pathname
            An explicit pointer to ptsname(3) is useful, as is a note
            of the fact that the slave device pathname exists only as
            long as the master device is held open.

raise.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some notes on underlying system call that is used

rcmd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details of the rresvport() 'port' argument

resolver.3
    Petr Baudis
        Note that many options are documented in resolv.conf(5)

scandir.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel J Blueman]
        Improve EXAMPLE source code: s/0/NULL/ in scandir() call

strchr.3
    James Hunt
        Explain behavior when searching for '\0'

strerror.3
    Eric Blake  [Stefan Puiu]
        Improve strerror_r() description
            POSIX requires that perror() not modify the static storage
            returned by strerror().  POSIX 2008 and C99 both require that
            strerror() never return NULL (a strerror() that always
            returns "" for all inputs is valid for C99, but not for POSIX).

            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12204
            documents glibc's change to come into compliance with POSIX
            regarding strerror_r() return value.  The GNU strerror_r() use
            of 'buf' was confusing - I ended up writing a test program that
            proves that 'buf' is unused for valid 'errnum', but contains
            truncated "unknown message" for out-of-range 'errnum'.

            See also http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=382
    Bernhard Walle
        Correct description of error return for XSI strerror_r()
    Michael Kerrisk [Eric Blake]
        Note how to use 'errno' to detect errors when calling strerror()
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Add an example of the kind of string returned by strerror()

resolv.conf.5
    Petr Baudis
        Document "single-request" option

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note buffer size that guarantees being able to read at least one event
    James Hunt
        Correct description of size of inotify_event structure

iso_8859-1.7
    Eugen Dedu
        Add "-" for SOFT HYPHEN
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=156154

netdevice.7
    Brian F. G. Bidulock
        Document some SIOC configuration ioctls
            This patch adds common but missing SIOC configuration ioctls to
            the netdevice.7 manual pages that are not documented anywhere
            else. SIOCSIFPFLAGS and SIOCGIFPFLAGS are linux-specific. Flag
            values come from Linux 2.6.25 kernel headers for sockios. The
            others are standard BSD ioctls that have always been implemented
            by Linux and were verified from inspecting netdevice.c kernel
            code.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alexey Toptygin]
        Correct description of SO_BROADCAST

tcp.7
    lepton
        Correct description for TCP_MAXSEG on modern kernel

CIRCLEQ_INSERT_TAIL.3
CIRCLEQ_REMOVE.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to queue.3
            The queue(3) page documents these macros, so it makes sense to
            have links for the names.

DES_FAILED.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to des_crypt.3
            The des_crypt(3) page documents this macro, so it makes sense

qsort_r.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to qsort.3
            Overlooked to add this link in 3.38, when documentation of

    Michael Kerrisk  [Andries E. Brouwer]
        Clarify that these functions operate on bytes, not (wide) characters
            Change 'character(s)' to 'byte(s)' to make clear that these
            functions operate on bytes, not wide / UTF8 characters.
            (POSIX uses 'byte(s)' similarly, to make this point.)

icmp.7
ipv6.7
packet.7
raw.7
rtnetlink.7
unix.7
x25.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove names of constants from NAME line
            Some of the sockets/network protocol pages included names of
            the corresponding address family constants in the NAME line,
            but this wasn't done consistently across all pages, and probably
            it adds little value in those pages that did do this. So, remove
            these constants from those pages that have them in the NAME
            section.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josh Triplett]
        Expand description of CLOCK_REALTIME
            Make it clear that this clock may be discontinuous, and is
            affected my incremental NTP and clock-adjtime(2) adjustments.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=540872

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewording to deemphasize libc5 details

fork.2
    Mike Frysinger
        ERRORS: add ENOSYS

        Add RETURN VALUE and ERRORS sections
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to NOTES for more info about 'tcache'

            Describe race of direct read and fork for unaligned buffers"
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/77571

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of wrapper function emulation
            Clarify that glibc (as well as old libc) provides emulation
            using select(2) on older kernels that don't have a poll()
            system call.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make the meaning of a zero timeout explicit
            Clarify that timeout==0 causes an immediate return, even if
            no file descriptors are ready.

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kasper Dupont]
        BUGS: Note O_APPEND + pwrite() does the wrong thing
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43178

recvmmsg.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' interval will be rounded up to the

            scheduling delays.

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand description of the self-pipe trick
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add further details on pselect6() system call that underlies pselect()

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' of semtimedop() is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' interval will be rounded up to the
            system clock granularity, and may overrun because of kernel
            scheduling delays.

signal.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'sig_t' requires _BSD_SOURCE
            Also remove some old Linux libc details

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' of sigtimedwait() is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.

stat.2
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Formatting fixes
            From "groff -ww" (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                warning: around line 442: table wider than line width

            GNU man uses line length of 78.

            Use text blocks.  Two spaces between sentences or better: start
            each sentence in a new line.

syscalls.2
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Formatting fixes
            From "groff -ww ..." (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                warning: around line 157: table wider than line width

dbopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Add header file <fcntl.h>
            Upstreamed from Debian, and consistent with FreeBSD
            dbopen(3) man page.

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note details of POSIX.1-2008 specification of 'b' in 'mode'
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        BUGS: fmemopen() doesn't correctly set file position in some cases
            If 'mode' is append, but 'size' does not cover a null byte
            in 'buf', then fmemopen() incorrectly sets the initial file
            position to -1, rather than the next byte after the end of
            the buffer.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13151
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: fmemopen() incorrectly handles size==0 case
            If size is zero, fmemopen() fails, This is surprising behavior,
            and not specified in POSIX.1-2008.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11216

            Reported-by; Alex Shinn <alexshinn@gmail.com>
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Note silent ABI change for fmemopen() in glibc 2.9
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        BUGS: Append mode does not force writes to append
            Append mode correctly sets the initial offset but does
            not force subsequent writes to append at end of stream.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13152
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        BUGS: Note inconsistent treatment of 'b' in 'mode'
            fopen() permits, for example, both "w+b" and "wb+",
            but only the latter is meaningful to fmemopen().

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12836

fopencookie.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Petr Baudis]
        Correct description of return for user-supplied 'write' function
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2074

    Jean-Michel Vourg√®re
        Note that AI_ADDRCONFIG is not affected by loopback addresses
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=660479

iconv.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Upstream useful NOTE from Debian
            Warn the reader that the pointer arguments can't be
            interpreted as C style strings. Also, note possible
            alignment requirements for the referenced bytes sequences,
    Michael Kerrisk
        Write a better paragraph introducing iconv() and its arguments

isgreater.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vincent Lefevre]
        Clarify that the arguments to these macros must be real-floating
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=609033

lio_listio.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that async notification occurs when *all* I/Os complete

makedev.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Correct return types of major() and minor()
            See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=754188

ascii.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Indent for "troff" makes table too wide
            Fix following from "groff -t -ww ...":

                warning: around line 53: table wider than line width

            Extra indent for "troff" makes the table look misplaced
            (default "ps" output).

cp1251.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        table too wide
            From "nroff -ww -t ...":

                warning: around line 44: table wider than line width

            Columns are made narrower (column gutter decreased).

ipv6.7
    Stefan Puiu
        Add ENODEV error for bind() to link-local IPv6 address

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        Clarify that SIGLOST is unused
    Michael Kerrisk
        Comment out crufty BUGS text on SIGLOST
            It must be a very long time since the statement there
            about SIGLOST was true. (The text seems to date back to
            1996.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update architectures for tables of signal numbers

utf-8.7
    Brian M. Carlson
        Two clarifications
            This patch clarifies that 0xc0 and 0xc1 are not valid in any UTF-8
            encoding[0], and it also references RFC 3629 instead of RFC 2279.

            [0] In order to have 0xc0, you'd have to have a two-byte encoding
            with all the data bits zero in the first byte (and thus only six
            bits of data), which would be an ASCII character encoded in the
            non-shortest form.  Similarly with 0xc1.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538641

ldconfig.8
nscd.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove path prefix from NAME line
            Command names shown in NAME are normally just the basename,
            not the full pathname of the command.

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Sami Kerola
        Global fix: use UR macro where applicable
            The syntax .UR http://example.com paired with .UE will create
            links which one can interact, if the pager allows that.  One
            way to see the effect is ask the man(1) command to use browser
            display, e.g.:

                man -H man7/uri.7

            ("\:" is optional groff syntax to permit hyphenless line breaks.)

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add note to SYNOPSIS that there is no glibc wrapper for system call
            Reduce the chance that the reader may be misled into thinking
            that there is a wrapper function for this system call by noting
            explicitly in the SYNOPSIS that there is no glibc wrapper and
            pointing the reader to NOTES for further details.

ioprio_set.2
    Colin McCabe
        Clarify the multithreaded behavior of ioprio_set(2)
    Michael Kerrisk  [–ú–∞—Ä–∫ –ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–±–µ—Ä–≥, Kalle Olavi Niemitalo]

            For IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS, who==0 means operate on the caller.
            For IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP, who==0 means operate on the caller's
            process group.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=652443

migrate_pages.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christoph Lameter, JoonSoo Kim]
        Fix description of return value

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        For MS_REMOUNT, source is ignored

mprotect.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rasmus Villemoes]
        'addr' argument is not const
            As reported by Rasmus:

                Both my system's man-pages (3.22) and the latest online
                (3.41) show:

                    int mprotect(const void *addr, size_t len, int prot);

                as the prototype for mprotect(2). However, POSIX [1] and the
                actual sys/mman.h (on all the systems I checked) do not have
                the const qualifier on the first argument.

msgctl.2
semctl.2
shmctl.2
svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Don't mention that ipc_perm is defined in <sys/ipc.h>
            There's no need to mention that the 'ipc_perm' structure
            is defined in <sys/ipc.h>. That's an implementation detail,
            and furthermore <sys/ipc.h> is itself included by the other
            System V IPC header files. The current text might lead the
            reader to conclude that they must include <sys/ipc.h>, which
            is not the case (it is required neither on Linux, nor by the
            standards).

msgctl.2
msgget.2
msgop.2
semctl.2
semget.2
semop.2
shmctl.2
shmget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> aren't strictly needed
            Add text to NOTES to say that the <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h>
            header files aren't required by Linux or the standards, but may
            be needed for portability to old systems.

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        Explain WNOHANG behavior and EINTR bug
            I didn't like the "SIGKILL operates similarly, with exceptions"
            phrase (if it's different, then it's not "similar", right?),
            and now I got around to changing it. Now it says simply:
            "SIGKILL does not generate signal-delivery-stop and therefore
            the tracer can't suppress it."

            Replaced "why WNOHANG is not reliable" example with a more
            realistic one (the one which actually inspired to add this
            information to man page in the first place): we got
            ESRCH - process is gone! - but waitpid(WNOHANG) can still
            confusingly return 0 "no processes to wait for".

            Replaced "This means that unneeded trailing arguments may
            be omitted" part with a much better recommendation
            to never do that and to supply zero arguments instead.
            (The part about "undocumentedness" of gcc behavior was bogus,
            btw - deleted).

            Expanded BUGS section with the explanation and an example
            of visible strace behavior on the buggy syscalls which
            exit with EINTR on ptrace attach. I hope this will lead
            to people submitting better bug reports to lkml about
            such syscalls.

seteuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version where setegid() implementation changed
            In glibc 2.2/2.3, setegid() switched from setregid() to setresgid().

set_tid_address.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename 'ctid' argument for consistency with clone(2) page
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some rewordings and minor clarifications

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel Zingaro]
        Some wording clarifications
            Mainly rewording things like "is delivered" to "becomes pending",
            which is more accurate terminology.

syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some more details to the description of syscall(2)
            And add another example of using syscall() to the program example.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kcmp(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move discussion of set_zone_reclaim(2) out of main table
            This system call was never visible to user space, so it makes
            sense to move it out of the main table of system calls into
            the notes below the table.

getifaddrs.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Adrian Dabrowski]
        Note that ifa_addr and ifa_netmask can be NULL

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Engelhardt]
        Handle -1 error from pathconf() in example code snippet
            Improve the example demonstrating allocation of a buffer
            for readdir_r() to handle -1 error return from pathconf().
            Otherwise, naive readers may think that pathconf() return
            value can be used without checking.

realpath.3
    Shawn Landden
        Use past tense with ancient history (libc4, libc5)

regex.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct SEE ALSO reference to glibc manual "regex" section

rtime.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Engelhardt]
        Fix broken pointer cast in example code

sem_close.3
sem_destroy.3
sem_getvalue.3
sem_init.3
sem_open.3
sem_post.3
sem_unlink.3
sem_wait.3
sem_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that "cc -pthread" is required; "-lrt" no longer works
            See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/manpages/+bug/874418

sigwait.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword "is delivered" to "becomes pending"

strcat.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some text to emphasize the dangers of buffer overruns
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add discussion of strlcat()

strcpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that info is lost when strncpy() doesn't null terminate
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some text to emphasize possibility of buffer runs with strcpy()
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a discussion of strlcpy()
            Inspired by https://lwn.net/Articles/506530/
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of the null-byte padding performed by strncpy()

tsearch.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: remove redundant discussion of unorthodox use of term "postorder"
            This point is already covered at greater length in the main
            text of the page (See the piece "More commonly, ...").
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify use for first argument to the twalk() 'action' function
            There's a number of details in POSIX that are omitted in
            the current version of this page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some wording fixes

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note effect of madvise(2) MADV_DONTDUMP flag

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND

glob.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Change 8 bit characters to 7 bit representation
            Fixes rendering errors for accented 'a' characters.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aaron Peschel]
        Update bash(1) command used to obtain classical globbing behavior
            The man page formerly noted the bash(1) v1 command to do this.

iso_8859-1.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Explanation of SOFT HYPHEN and the code for it
            <groff: iso_8859-2.7>:89: warning: can't find special character `shc'

            This is the only "iso_8859-*.7" file that has this (now)
            undefined character.  The code in column four in "iso_8859-1.7" is
            "0x2D" ("HYPHEN, MINUS SIGN" or "HYPHEN-MINUS") instead of "0xAD".
            See Debian bug 156154 (or package "manpages").

            There should be an explanation for this graphic character and the
            code should be 0xAD in iso_8859-1.7 (as in all others), even
            though "[gn]roff" does not display a "HYPHEN" in that position of
            the table.

            The line with "SOFT HYPHEN" gets a footnote and a short
            explanation.

mdoc.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Fixing a warning and a table
            Fis warning from "groff -ww ..." (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                <groff: mdoc.7>:294: warning:
                tab character in unquoted macro argument

            In one table the distance between columns is too small in the
            "ps" output.  (Bug in the groff "doc.tmac" macro?)

mdoc.samples.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Fix warnings from [ng]roff, corrections
            From "man -ww ..." (groff -ww ...):

                <standard input>:541: warning:
                tab character in unquoted macro argument
                [+3 similar warnings]
                <standard input>:813: warning: macro `Pu' not defined
                Usage: .Rv -std in sections 2 and 3 only (#1669)
                mdoc warning: A .Bl directive has no matching .El (#1821)

            String "Pu" defined as a row of punctuation characters.
            ".Bl" and ".El" fixed.
            Some arguments, that start with a period or are the name of a
            macro, protected with "\&".
            Variable name for macro ".Rv" corrected.

netdevice.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: netdevice.7: warning: around line 98:
                table wider than line width

            Fix: No right adjustment in text blocks in tables.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673873

netlink.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table is too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: netlink.7: warning: around line 195:
                table wider than line width

            Horizontal line incorporated into table.
            No right adjustment of text blocks in tables.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673875
    Simon Paillard  [Herbert Xu]
        Change description of "*_pid" fields to "Port ID"
            As reported by Herbert Xu, these should not be considered as PIDs.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=383296

rtnetlink.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: rtnetlink.7: warning: around line 415:
                table wider than line width

            Column gutter reduced to fit line length.
            Right adjustment in text blocks removed in tables.
            Some header made centered in tables.
            One table put on same page.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674051

socket.7
    Martin H
        Document SO_MARK socket option
            Commit 4a19ec5800fc3bb64e2d87c4d9fdd9e636086fe0 in Jan 2008 added
            the new SO_MARK socket option.

            This patch is based on text from the commit message.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16461.

svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Remove include of <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h>
            Including <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> isn't needed on Linux
            and isn't really relevant for the explanation on this page.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Fredrik Arnerup]
        Describe timeout limitation in kernels < 2.6.37
            As reported by Fredrik (and as far as I can tell the problem
            went back to 2.6.0):

            The timeout argument has an upper limit. Any values above that
            limit are treated the same as -1, i.e. to wait indefinitely.
            The limit is given by:

                #define EP_MAX_MSTIMEO min(1000ULL * MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ, \
                (LONG_MAX - 999ULL) / HZ)

            That is, the limit depends on the size of a long and the timer
            frequency.  Assuming the a long is never smaller than 32 bits
            and HZ never larger than 1000, the worst case is 35 minutes.
            I think this should be mentioned under "BUGS".

            Although this is likely to be fixed in the future
            (http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/8/144), the problem exists in
            at least 2.6.14 - 2.6.35. I don't know if select(2) and poll(2)
            are affected.

            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20762
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to select(2) for discussion of close in another thread

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Note Linux's odd handling of the new_value==NULL case
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Fix types used to declare fields in timeval struct

keyctl.2
    David Pr√©vot
        Reorder SEE ALSO, without .br

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to select(2) for discussion of close in another thread

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephane Fillod]
        Note behavior if monitored file descriptor is closed in another thread
            Executive summary: a sane application can't rely on any
            particular behavior if another thread closes a file descriptor
            being monitored by select().

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40852
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify equivalent pselect() code in terms of threads
            s/sigprogmask/pthread_sigmask/

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion of blocking behavior in terms of threads
            semop() blocks the calling thread, not the process.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add clone(2)
            Give reader a clue about CLONE_SYSVSEM.

shutdown.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Dumazet]
        Document EINVAL error (and associated bug)
            Eric Dumazet noted that EINVAL was not documented. Some further
            digging shows that it's also not diagnosed consistently.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47111.

            Some edits to Adrian's patch by mtk.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: Note SUS details for wait3()

gnu_get_libc_version.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded "#define _GNU_SOURCE" from SYNOPSIS

pthread_kill.3
pthread_sigqueue.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove wording "another"
            Writing "another thread" in these pages implies that these
            functions can't be used to send a signal to the calling thread
            itself, which is of course untrue.

sigvec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "int" arg to sv_handler definition in sigvec structure
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix small error in discussion of blocking of signals
            The signal that causes the handler to be invoked is blocked,
            but saying "by default" implies that this can be changed via
            the API. It cannot. (One needs sigaction(2) for that.)

syslog.3
    Simon Josefsson
        Remove (apparently bogus) text claiming LOG_AUTH is deprecated
            LOG_AUTH is in POSIX, and widely available. There
            seems to be no basis to the claim it is deprecated.

            Quoting Simon:
                I cannot find any other source that claim LOG_AUTH is
                deprecated in any way.  LOG_AUTH is distinct from
                LOG_AUTHPRIV.  The GNU C Library manual only documents
                LOG_AUTH.  The header files contains both without any
                comment.  Common systems like Debian appear to refer to
                both auth and authpriv facilities in syslog configurations.
                Popular daemons appear to use both facilities.
                Both facilities are discussed in several RFCs.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46091

        SEE ALSO: Add ctermid(3)

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify header file related to 'flags' field of /proc/PID/stat
    Michael Kerrisk  [Fr√©d√©ric Bri√®re]
        Update description of 'starttime' field of /proc/PID/stat
            The unit of measurement changed from jiffies to clock ticks in
            Linux 2.6.

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe interpretation of slashes in dependency strings
    Michael Kerrisk
        Repeat note that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is ignored in privileged programs
            This point is already noted when discussing search order for
            libraries, but it's worth repeating under the specific discussion
            of LD_LIBRARY_PATH further down the page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details for LD_PRELOAD
        Note that LD_PRELOAD list separator can be space or colon

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

delete_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to Linux 2.6+ reality
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change license and copyright
            There is now nothing left of the original FSF-copyrighted
            page. So, change the copyright and license.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Lucas De Marchi, Rusty Russell]
        Substantial reorganization after comments from Rusty Russell
            Rusty notes that O_NONBLOCK is almost always used in
            practice. Therefore, it would be better to reorganize
            the page to consider that "the default".

init_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to Linux 2.6+ reality
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change copyright and license
            Little of the original page now remains. Change
            copyright and license
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rusty Russell]
        Changes after review comments from Rusty Russell

getauxval.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document getauxval() function added in glibc 2.16


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: Use consistent capitalization in NAME section
            The line(s) in the NAME section should only use capitals
            where English usage dictates that. Otherwise, use
            lowercase throughout.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: "userspace" ==> "user space" or "user-space"
            Existing pages variously use "userspace or "user space".
            But, "userspace" is not quite an English word.
            So change "userspace" to "user space" or, when used
            attributively, "user-space".

    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/meminfo
            Info mostly taken from Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
            and Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Default for /proc/sys/fs/protected_{hardlinks,symlinks} is now 0
            The default setting of 1 in/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
            and /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks caused one too many
            breakages for Linus's taste, so commit 561ec64ae67e changed
            the default for both files to 0.
        Note system call error yielded by /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks
            Note that violating 'protected_symlinks' restrictions
            causes system calls to fail with the error EACCES.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 2.6.27, /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe depends on CONFIG_MODULES

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since 2.6.30, CLONE_NEWIPC also supports POSIX message queues

delete_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small rewording of description of effect of O_TRUNC

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Document Linux's nonstandard treatment or RLIMIT_CPU soft limit
            Upon encountering the RLIMIT_CPU soft limit when a SIGXCPU handler
            has been installed, Linux invokes the signal handler *and* raises
            the soft limit by one second. This behavior repeats until the
            limit is encountered.  No other implementation that I tested
            (Solaris 10, FreeBSD 9.0, OpenBSD 5.0) does this, and it seems
            unlikely to be POSIX-conformant. The (Linux-specific)
            RLIMIT_RTTIME soft limit exhibits similar behavior.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Point reader at discussion of /proc/[pid]/limits in proc(5)

io_getevents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        io_getevents() may cause segfault when called with invalid ctx_id
            For reference see: http://marc.info/?l=linux-aio&m=130089887002435&w=2

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Dumazet]
        UNIX domain sockets support MSG_TRUNC since 3.4

sendmmsg.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add example program for sendmmsg()

stat.2
    Simon Paillard
        Clarify description of EOVERFLOW error
            The EOVERFLOW error is not only for st_size, but also
            inode and block size fields. See glibc source file
            sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/xstatconv.c and kernel source
            file fs/stat.c. Also, fix bit/byte confusion
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=604928

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update various references to "i386" to "x86"

            more readable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel symbolic 'type' names
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD semantics
            SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD returns the number of bytes
            available for reading via SYSLOG_ACTION_READ.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify where SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_ALL places data it reads
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify semantics of SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR
            The SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR command (5) does not really clear
            the ring buffer; rather it affects the semantics of what
            is returned by commands 3 (SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_ALL) and
            4 (SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_CLEAR).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of privileges for commands 3 and 10
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk  [Julien Cristau]
        Update description of ifa_data to Linux 2.6+ reality
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526778

memcmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Enhance RETURN VALUE text and remove redundant text from DESCRIPTION
            Note that sign of result equals sign of difference between
            first two bytes that differ (treated as "unsigned char")."

mkstemp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Deemphasize discussion of mode 066 in glibc 2.0.6
            Glibc 2.0.6 is now so ld that the discussion of details
            of that version can be deemphasized placing just under
            NOTES.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51811

strcmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Enhance RETURN VALUE text and remove redundant text from DESCRIPTION
            Note that sign of result equals sign of difference between
            first two bytes that differ (treated as "unsigned char")."

ttyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix confused text in ERRORS
            The existing text suggested that the ERRORS applied
            only for ttyname_r(). However, 2 of the 3 errors
            can occur for ttyname().

undocumented.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove some now documented functions

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jim Paris]
        Correct description of SwapFree in /proc/meminfo
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note change of /proc/[pid]/limits file permissions in 2.6.36

    Simon Paillard
        Document IPv6 format for nameserver
            See: http://bugs.debian.org/610036

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rens van der Heijden]
        Correct URL for POSIX.1e draft

ipv6.7
    Gao Feng
        Add description of getsockopt() for IPV6_MTU
            In IPv4,IP_MTU is only supported by getsockopt.
            In IPv6, we can use IPV6_MTU to set socket's MTU,
            but the return value of getsockopt() is the path MTU.

rtnetlink.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Julien Cristau]
        Update description of IFLA_STATS to Linux 2.6+ reality
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526778

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [YOSHIFUJI Hideaki]
        Document 'sockaddr' and 'sockaddr_storage' types
    Andi Kleen
        Explain effect of SO_SNDTIMEO for connect()
            When SO_SNDTIMEO is set before connect(), then connect()
            may return EWOULDBLOCK when the timeout fires.

--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/tty/terminal/


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel versions for various CLONE_* constants
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_NEWIPC governs mechanisms that don't have filesystem pathnames
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_NEWIPC doesn't mount the POSIX MQ file system
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program (CLONE_NEWUTS)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some reworking of CLONE_NEWIPC text
            No substantial content changes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add kcmp(2)
        SEE ALSO: add setns(2)

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        FALLOC_FL_* flags are defined in glibc only since 2.18

getxattr.2
removexattr.2
setxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andrew Perepechko, ]
        Note that ENOATTR is a synonym for ENODATA
            Various people have pointed out that strace(1) shows ENODATA
            for the case where the named attribute does not exist, or
            the process has no access to this attribute. ENODATA
            and ENOATTR are in fact defined as synonyms. Point this out
            in the man page, so that people understand the strace(1) info.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51871

getxattr.2
listxattr.2
removexattr.2
setxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Put errors under ERRORS section
            The errno values on these pages were listed in a nonstandard
            way under the RETURN VALUE section. Put them in ERRORS sections.

init_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rusty Russell]
        ERRORS: Add errors for module signatures (EBADMSG, ENOKEY)

link.2
mkdir.2
mknod.2
open.2
rename.2
symlink.2
write.2
mkfifo.3
    Mark Hills
        Document EDQUOT error
            The return error EDQUOT is not documented in open(2), write(2),
            symlink(2) etc.

            Whether inodes or disk blocks are required for each function
            is something I based on received wisdom and BSD documentation,
            rather than tracing the code to the kernel. For symlink(2)
            this certainly depends on the file system type.

listxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Theodore Ts'o]
        Fix RETURN VALUE description
            On success, 0 may be returned, so change wording from
            "positive number" to "nonnegative number".

outb.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add SYNOPSIS

prctl.2
    Kees Cook
        Document PR_SET_PTRACER
            Document the Yama LSM's prctl handler that allows processes to
            declare ptrace restriction exception relationships via
            PR_SET_PTRACER.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it explicit that PR_SET_PTRACER replaces previous setting
            The attribute is a scalar, not a list.
    Shawn Landden
        Document EINVAL error for PR_SET_PTRACER
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document PTRACE_O_EXITKILL
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place PTRACE_SETOPTIONS list in alphabetical order

query_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Must be called using syscall(2)
            Yes, the call is way obsolete, but add this info
            for completeness.

recvmmsg.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add/correct kernel version info for recvmmsg() and MSG_WAITFORNONE
            This patch isolates the since/version related fixes as requested.
            This change introduces the following delta:
             * The page states it was added in 2.6.32 but it is only added
                2.6.33 (ref: http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33)
             * The MSG_WAITFORONE flag was in turn only added in 2.6.34

        Add utrap_install(2)
            Sparc-specific, present since ancient times
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add finit_module(2)

sysctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Garrett Cooper]
        ERRORS: EACCES as a synonym for EPRM

        Remove crufty text about 'time_t' on "other systems"
            Back in 2006, some text came in via Debian patches that seems
            crufty. Remove it.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add proper page cross refs for alternate functions

core.5
proc.5
    Kees Cook
        Clarify suid_dumpable versus core_pattern
            In Linux 3.6, additional requirements were placed on core_pattern
            when suid_dumpable is set to 2. Document this and include commit
            references.
    Justin Lebar
        statm's "shared" field refers to pages backed by files
            I noticed that statm's "shared" field doesn't match the sum of
            all the "shared" entries in smaps [1].

            The kernel docs explain that statm's "shared" field is "number of
            pages that are shared (i.e. backed by a file)" [2].  smaps appears
            to call a page shared if it's mapped by at least two processes,
            which explains this discrepancy.

            I'm not a kernel hacker, but it appears to me they do mean "i.e."
            and not "e.g." in the statm description: In
            fs/proc/task_mmu.c::task_statm, I see

                *shared = get_mm_counter(mm, MM_FILEPAGES);

            Here's a patch which updates the man page to match the (hopefully
            correct) kernel docs.

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fallocate(1)

regex.3
    Reuben Thomas
        Clarify details of matching
            The first is that it's far from clear that the end points of the
            complete string match are stored in the zero'th element of the
            regmatch_t array; secondly, the phrase "next largest substring
            match" is positively misleading, implying some sort of size
            ordering, whereas in fact they are ordered according to their
            appearance in the regex pattern.

scanf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify meaning of "string conversions" for 'm' modifier
    Mike Frysinger

            POSIX.1-2008 adopted the 'm' flag for dynamic allocation. Update
            page to cover it and relegate the glibc-specific 'a' flag to
            NOTES.

    Peter Schiffer
        Add max-db-size and auto-propagate descriptions, default values, + misc
             * added missing valid services (services and netgroup)
             * added many default values for options
             * reordered options according to the nscd.conf file
               (logical order)

            the value in /proc/sys/fs/file-max.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note message written to kernel log when file-max limit is hit
            Info from Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt.

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: remove unneeded double quotes in .SH headings

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: remove unneeded double quotes in .SS headings

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: use consistent capitalization in .SS headings
            Capitalization in .SS sections across pages (and sometimes even
            within a single page) is wildly inconsistent. Make it consistent.
            Capitalize first word in heading, but otherwise use lower case,
            except where English usage (e.g., proper nouns) or programming
            language requirements (e.g., identifier names) dictate otherwise.
Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Denys Vlasenko]
        Remove double blank lines in output

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix order of SH sections


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NAME: Add "accept4"

access.2
    Colin Walters
        Note that access() may also fail for FUSE
            Since in some cases (e.g. libguestfs's guestmount) it also has the
            semantics where files can appear owned by root, but are actually
            mutable by the user, despite what one might infer from the Unix
            permissions.

getpeername.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kai Kunschke]
        Clarify semantics of getpeername() for datagram sockets
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674034

getuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove duplicate section heading

mmap.2
    Cyril Hrubis
        Add note about partial page in BUGS section
            This adds a note about Linux behavior with partial page at the end
            of the object. The problem here is that a page that contains only
            part of a file (because the file size is not multiple of PAGE_SIZE)
            stays in page cache even after the mapping is unmapped and the file
            is closed. So if some process dirties such page, other mappings
            will see the changes rather than zeroes.
    Michael Kerrisk  [T√∂r√∂k Edwin]
        Some 'flags' values require a feature test macro to be defined
            Add text to NOTES noting that some MAP_* constants are
            defined only if a suitable feature test macro is defined.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=542601
    Cyril Hrubis
        Document EOVERFLOW error

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify list of file creation flags
            POSIX.1-2008 TC1 clarified this, so that O_CLOEXEC,
            O_DIRECTORY, and O_NOFOLLOW are also in this list.

prctl.2
    Cyrill Gorcunov
        Add some details for PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS

read.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Zack Weinberg]
        Clarify interaction of count==0 and error checking
            POSIX deliberately leaves this case open, so the man
            page should be less specific about what happens.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=533232
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marc Lehmann]
        Remove crufty text about O_NONBLOCK on files
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700529
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details for seekable files

unimplemented.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Schiffer]
        Add various STREAMS interfaces to NAME
            Taken from Red Hat downstream.

            See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=436407

cexp2.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Still does not exist in glibc 2.17

exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that a call to execve() clears exit handler registrations

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add gai.conf(5)

malloc_trim.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove duplicate section title

printf.3
    Marshel Abraham  [Graham Gower, Graham Gower]
        Fix error handling in example code
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23282

pthread_yield.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aristeu Rozanski]
        Add _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro to SYNOPSIS

resolver.3
resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nathan Stratton Treadway, Simon Heimberg]
        RES_DEBUG is only available if glibc is compiled with debug support
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=692136
            and https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43061

strtol.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Schiffer]
        Remove crufty text from previous fix

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CONFIG_COREDUMP

capabilities.7
    Andrey Vagin
        Nonexistent bits are no longer shown as set in /proc/PID/status Cap*

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        A monitoring process can't easily distinguish events triggered by itself

ip.7
    Flavio Leitner  [Peter Schiffer]
        Improve explanation about calling listen() or connect()

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe rules for capitalization in .SS headings

rtnetlink.7
    Pavel Emelyanov
        Add info about ability to create links with given index
            Since kernel v3.7 the RTM_NEWLINK message now accepts nonzero
            values in ifi_index field. Mention this fact in the respective
            rtnetlink.7 section.

socket.7
    Pavel Emelyanov
        SO_BINDTODEVICE is now readable
            SO_BINDTODEVICE is readable since since kernel 3.8.


==================== Changes in man-pages-3.49 ====================

Released: 2013-03-10, Munich


Contributors
------------

The following people contributed patches/fixes or (noted in brackets
in the changelog below) reports, notes, and ideas that have been
incorporated in changes in this release:

Michael Kerrisk <mtk.manpages@gmail.com>


Global changes
--------------

The goal of the changes below to consistently format copyright
and license information in the comments in the page source
at the top of each page. This allows for easy scripting to
extract that information. Following these changes the comments
the top of the page source should now consistently have the form:

    .\" <copyright info, possibly spread over several lines>
    .\"
    .\" %%%LICENSE_START(<license-type>)
    .\" <license text>
    .\" %%%LICENSE_END
    .\" <other comments>

Note that the 'license-type' is merely descriptive.  Its purpose is
to simplify scripting for the purpose of gathering statistics on
types of licenses used in man-pages.  It is NOT a statement about
the actual licensing of the page; that license is contain INSIDE the
LICENSE_START...LICENSE_END clause.


All pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a LICENSE_START()...LICENSE_END clause in source at
        top of each page that encapsulates the license text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Put copyright info at top of page, followed by blank line and LICENSE

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
         Update info in source comments on where to get a copy of the GPL

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "Hey Emacs" comment in page source
            Only certain pages have this; there is no consistency, so
            remove it from all pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "-*- nroff -*-" comment at top of source

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=643854

random.4
    Elie De Brauwer
        Document write and document the ioctl interface of /dev/random
            The update consists out of two parts:
             - a minor thing which just documents what happens if a write to
               /dev/(u)random is performed, which is used in the example
               script but not explicitly mentioned.
             - the other (biggest) part is the documentation of the ioctl()
               interface which /dev/(u)random exposes. This ioctl() lives in
               drivers/char/random.c and the primitives can be found in
               include/linux/random.h

            One comment remains, there used to be an RNDGETPOOL ioctl() which
            disappeared in v2.6.9. I found two patches on the net:
            - http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.8.1/2.6.8.1-mm4/broken-out/dev-random-remove-rndgetpool-ioctl.patch
            - https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/25/168

            But as far as I can tell the first one got applied but the 2nd
            one seems more correct. The result is that even today one can
            still find traces of the RNDGETPOOL ioctl() in the header files.
            Is this there for historical reasons or because it might break
            userspace, even though using it will just give an EINVAL.

bootparam.7
    Jose Luis Domingo Lopez
        Document 'rootfstype' option
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=182014

            Info obtained by grepping the kernel source.

        Improve description
            The description was rather vague, citing a "list of I/O contexts"
            and stating that it "can" cancel outstanding requests.  This
            update makes things more concrete so that the reader knows exactly
            what's going on.

io_getevents.2
    Jeff Moyer
        The 'timeout' argument is not updated
            I looked back through the kernel code, and the timeout was
            never updated in any case.  I've submitted a patch upstream
            to change the comment above io_getevents.

io_setup.2
    Jeff Moyer
        Clarify nr_events
            nr_events is technically the number of completion events that can
            be stored in the completion ring.  The wording of the man page:
            "capable of receiving at least nr_events" seems dubious to me,
            only because I worry that folks might interpret that to mean
            'nr_events' total, instead of 'nr_events' concurrently.

            Further, I've added information on where to find the per-user
            limit on 'nr_events', /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr.  Let me know if
            you think that is not relevant.

listxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain use of 'size' argument

lseek.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Jaeger]
        _GNU_SOURCE must be defined to get SEEK_DATE and SEEK_HOLE definitions
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15312

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointers to relevant /proc files described in proc(5)

posix_fadvise.2
pread.2
readahead.2
sync_file_range.2
truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to syscall(2) for ABI semantics on certain 32-bit architectures
            Also: in sync_file_range.2 and posix_fadvise.2 remove description
            of conventional calling signature as flawed, and in
            posix_fadvise.2, de-emphasize focus on ARM, and rather phrase
            as a more general discussion of certain architectures.

readdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        readdir(2) doesn't exist on x86-64

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the discussion of 'semadj'

shmctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to proc(5) for description of /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced

syscall.2
    Changhee Han
        Add notes that caution users when passing arguments to syscall()
            For example, passing 'long long' on ARM-32 requires special
            treatment.
    Mike Frysinger [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document the exact calling convention for architecture system calls
    Mike Frysinger  [Kyle McMartin]
        Add PA-RISC details under calling conventions
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]

unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements
            The requirements quietly changed changed in glibc 2.14

            See also http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4749

fopencookie.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ralph Loader]
        Correct definition of cookie_io_functions_t

pthread_setname_np.3
    Andrew Clayton
        The thread argument is passed in by value

readir.3
seekdir.3
telldir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Eliminate the implication that these functions deal with "offsets"
            The directory position dealt with by the readdir() and
            friends is not a simple file offset in modern file systems.
            Typically, it is some kind of cookie value. Add text and
            make other changes to these pages to eliminate the
            implication that this is an offset, and warn the reader
            that directory positions should be treated strictly as
            opaque values.

            In the process, rename the 'offset' argument of seekdir(3)
            to 'loc', and add some text to readdir(3) to note that
            the 'd_off' field is the same value returned by telldir(3)
            at the current directory position.

            See also http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4749

ualarm.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nicolas Hillegeer]
        Add note on the behavior when 'usecs' is zero
            POSIX.1-2001 does not specify the behavior in this case
            and no other system that I checked documented the behavior.
            Probably, most or all systems do what Linux does in this
            case: cancel any pending alarm, just as alarm(0) does.
            Add that info in NOTES.

elf.5
    Mike Frysinger
        Add byte positions for all EI_xxx fields
            When describing e_ident, most of the EI_xxx defines mention the
            exact byte number.  This is useful when manually hacking an ELF
            with a hex editor.  However, the last few fields don't do this,
            which means you have to count things up yourself.
            Add a single word to each so you don't have to do that.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to sched_rr_get_interval(2) for info on sched_rr_timeslice_ms
            Since Linux 3.9, /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms can
            be used to change the SCHED_RR quantum.

    Krzysztof Konopko
        Simplify the example of printing out environ
            The binutils package contains a very handy utility to
            print out null-byte delimited strings from a file.  This
            can replace a rather complex expression with cat(1)
            provided as an example for printing out /proc/[pid]/environ.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update /proc/PID/maps example
            Update to 64-bit example that includes "[heap]", "[stack],
            and "[vdso]"

ip.7
    Radek Pazdera
        Document IP_MULTICAST_ALL
            This commit adds documentation for the IP_MULTICAST_ALL socket
            option.

            The option was added to the Linux kernel in 2.6.31:

                Author Nivedita Singhvi <niv@us.ibm.com>
                Commit f771bef98004d9d141b085d987a77d06669d4f4f

            The description is based on a previous one [3] posted by the
            original author of the code -- Nivedita, but it is slightly
            re-worded.

            I tested it myself and it works as described.

units.7
    Brian M. Carlson
        units should use an actual ¬µ
            The units(7) man page uses an ASCII u in place of the actual Greek
            letter mu.  Since we're in the twenty-first century, with
            UTF-8-compatible terminals and terminal emulators, we should use
            the actual letter ¬µ instead of an ASCII approximation.

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Add PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP documentation
            The perf_event_open() ENABLE/DISABLE/RESET ioctls can take an
            argument, PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP.  This wasn't documented at all
            until about a year ago (despite the support being there from
            the beginning) so I missed this when initially writing
            the man page.

socket.7
    Pavel Emelyanov, Michael Kerrisk
        Document SO_PEEK_OFF option
            Since Linux 3.4 there appeared an ability to specify the
            offset in bytes from which the data will be MSG_PEEK-ed.
            Describe this socket option in the socket(7) page, where
            all the other socket options are described.


Global changes
--------------

Various pages

asprintf.
getline.3
getlogin.3
pthread_setname_np.3

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Peter LaDow
       Add envp to the Linux notes about NULL pointers
            During the review of static analysis results, we discovered a
            functional, but non-portable, use of execve().  For example:

                char *cmd[] = { "/path/to/some/file", NULL };
                execve(cmd[0], cmd, NULL);

            The call succeeds.  Yet, the static analysis tool (rightly)
            pointed out that envp could be dereferenced.  But digging into
            glibc and the kernel, it appears that like argv, envp when NULL
            is treated as if it were an empty list.

            So, to clear things up, I'm submitting this patch to update the
            man page to indicate that envp is treated like argv.

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        RETURN VALUE: mention that 'errno' is set on error

io_setup.2
    Cyril Hrubis  [Jeff Moyer]
        Clarify the nr_events parameter
            Currently the io_setup.2 man page describes what the kernel really
            does, i.e., that the resulting context may be able to hold more
            than the 'nr_event's operations because the memory allocated in
            kernel is rounded to be multiple of page size.

            It is better not to expose this implementation detail and
            simply state that the resulting context is suitable for
            'nr_events' operations.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify the perf_event_open() wakeup_events/wakeup_watermark fields
            Clarify the perf_event_open() wakeup_events/wakeup_watermark
            fields a bit, based on info from kernel commit cfeb1d90a1b1.
    Vince Weaver
        Update to match the Linux 3.10 release
            This patch updates the perf_event_open() documentation to include
            new interfaces added in the 3.10 kernel.

            It also documents a few [To be documented] instances left over
            from the 3.7 kernel.
    Vince Weaver
        Small correction to description of 'flags' argument

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note equivalents of PR_SET_NAME
            pthread_setname_np() and pthread_getname_np() and
            /proc/self/task/TID/comm provide access to the same
            attribute.

pread.2

        pread() and pwrite() are especially useful in multithreaded applications

            - add -std=c11 to the list of strict options
            - emphasize more that both the gcc option and not including
              alloca.h are needed

pthread_attr_setscope.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Manuel Traut, Siddhesh Poyarekar]
        The inherit-scheduler attribute must be set to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
            In order for the attributes set by these functions to have
            an effect, the caller must use pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3)
            to set the inherit-scheduler attribute of the attributes object

    J√©r√©mie Galarneau
        copy the string returned by getenv()
            The example of a portable version of timegm() uses the string
            returned by getenv() after calling setenv() on the same
            environment variable. The tz string may be invalid as per
            getenv.3:

                    "The string pointed to by the return value of getenv()
                     may be statically allocated, and can be modified by a

        Clarify that null byte is '\0'

iso_8859-2.7
    Eric S. Raymond
        Remove incorrect reference to nonexistent groff glyph \[shc]
            The reference incorrectly attempted to duplicate an
            actual soft hyphen (hex 0xad) just before it in the file.

man-pages.7
    Peng Haitao
        Add description of "ATTRIBUTES"
            "ATTRIBUTES" section can mention thread safety,

clock_nanosleep.2
futex.2
nanosleep.2
poll.2
sigaction.2
sigreturn.2
signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add restart_syscall(2)

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk [Geoffrey Thomas]
        Remove warning that O_DIRECTORY is only for use with opendir(3)
            O_DIRECTORY can also be used with, for example, O_PATH.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Improve PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK documentation
    Vince Weaver
        Fix indentation of the MMAP layout section
            The indentation of the MMAP layout section wasn't quite right.
            I think this improves things but I admit I'm not an expert at the
            low-level indentation directives.
    Vince Weaver
        Update PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP info
            It turns out PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP was broken from 75f937f24bd9
            (in Linux 2.6.31, the initial perf_event release) until
            724b6daa1 (Linux 3.4).

            I've done some extensive kernel source code digging plus
            running tests of various kernels and I hope the info
            presented is accurate now.

            (Patch edited somewhat by mtk.)
    Vince Weaver
        Improve sysfs files documentation
            This improves the documentation of the various
            perf_event_open()-related sysfs files.

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        If SEIZE was used, initial auto-attach stop is EVENT_STOP
            For every PTRACE_O_TRACEfoo option, mention that old-style SIGSTOP
            is replaced by PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE attach was used.

            Mention the same thing again in the description of
            PTRACE_EVENT_STOP.
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        Mention that PTRACE_PEEK* libc API and kernel API are different
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        Clarify PTRACE_INTERRUPT, PTRACE_LISTEN, and group-stop behavior

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document use of empty 'pathname' argument
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change error check in example program from "< 0" to "== -1"
    Chuck Coffing
        Fix possible race condition in readlink.2 example
            I noticed that the example in the readlink.2 man pages does error
            checking for a race condition that would cause the value of the
            symbolic link to get larger.  However, it doesn't handle the
            opposite case, in which the value gets shorter.  (The NULL
            terminator is always set at the old, longer offset.)  This could
            cause the program to operate on uninitialized data.

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [graud@gmx.com]
        s/SIGTSTP/SIGTTIN/ when discussing reads from terminal
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60504

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

ioctl_list.2
    Zsb√°n Ambrus
        Document FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES
            The attached patch adds four ioctls from linux/msdos_fs.h to the
            ioctl_list(2) manpage.

            The ioctl FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES reads FAT attributes of a
            file a mounted vfat file system.  I tested this on Linux
            2.6.33, an example script can be found at
            http://www.perlmonks.com/?node_id=832623


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/file system/filesystem/
            Notwithstanding 24d01c530c5a3f75217543d02bf6712395e5f90c,
            "filesystem" is the form used by the great majority of man pages
            outside the man-pages project and in a number of other sources,
            so let's go with that.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    J. Bruce Fields
        Fix outdated NFS information
            Note that NFS versions since version 3 support an "access" call
            so that the client doesn't have to guess permissions or ID
            mapping on its own.

            (See RFC 1813 sections 1.7 and 3.3.4.)

adjtimex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add adjtimex(8)

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rodrigo Campos]
        Note circumstances in which "SMP" note applies.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version for CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
            appeared in 2.6.12.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add VERSIONS section

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The 'timeout' can be rounded upwards by clock granularity and also overrun

kill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small improvements to text on historical rules for permissions

nfsservctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note commands that were only in Linux 2.4.x and earlier

open.2
    Robert Harris
        Add mmap(2) to list of calls that fail when given an O_PATH descriptor
    Doug Goldstein
        Add EINVAL to errors list
            EINVAL can be returned by open(2) when the underlying filesystem
            doesn't support O_DIRECT. It is documented in the NOTES section
            but this patch adds it to the list of possible errors.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK updates
            This started out as just adding the new perf_event_open features
            from Linux 3.11 (which was the addition of transactional memory
            defines for PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK samples) but turned into a
            general cleanup of the PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK documentation.

            The main clarification is that at least one of the non-privilege
            values must be set or else perf_event_open() will return an EINVAL
            error.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder text describing fields of 'perf_event_header' structure
            Place the fields with the shorter descriptions first, to make the
            information easier to read.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording of 'timeout' as a "minimum" interval

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christos Tsopokis]
        Clarify that these system calls affect a per-thread attribute

sched_setparam.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that this system call applies to threads (not processes)

sched_setscheduler.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that this system call applies to threads (not processes)

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [G.raud]
        Clarify wording of 'timeout' as a "minimum" interval

setfsgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Oleg Nesterov]
        Clarify description of return value
            More clearly describe the weirdness in the return value of this
            system call, and note the problems it creates in BUGS

        Clarify historical details and note that setfsuid() is obsolete
    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording improvements
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct header file in SYNOPSIS

    Michael Kerrisk  [Will Newton]
        Clarify wording on "return value" when size==0

printf.3
    Christopher Hall
        Correctly describe the meaning of a negative precision
            The printf(3) manpage says that a negative precision is taken to
            be zero, whereas printf(3p) says that a negative precision is
            taken as if the precision were omitted.  glibc agrees with the
            latter (POSIX) specification.

            Test code:

                printf("%f\n",42.0);      // "42.000000"
                printf("%.*f\n",0,42.0);  // "42"
                printf("%.*f\n",-1,42.0); // "42.000000"

            This patch corrects the explanation to match what actually happens.

            Attempt to document fields in the /proc/[pid]/io file, based on
            the Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt. The text will probably
            need some grammar corrections.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        /proc/sys/fs/inode-max went away in Linux 2.4
            Also, the 'preshrink' field in /proc/sys/fs/inode-state became
            a dummy value in Linux 2.4.

Global changes
--------------

assert.3
assert_perror.3
rexec.3
rpc.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Reword a sentence to use more gender-neutral language


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        'arg...' for interpreter scripts starts with argv[1]

fallocate.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Clarify the zeroing behavior
            fallocate() zeroes only space that did not previously contain
            data, but leaves existing data untouched.

futex.2
    Rodrigo Campos
        Fix link to Rusty's futex example library
            When I asked to webmaster@kernel.org, Konstantin Ryabitsev
            answered that the ".nl." is "an obsolete scheme and really
            should be changed to just ftp.kernel.org".

getgroups.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that NGROUPS_MAX is defined in <limits.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) is a run-time technique
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max

ioctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [KOSAKI Motohiro, David Gibson]
        'request' argument is typed as 'unsigned long' in glibc
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42705

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 rdpmc/mmap
            It turns out that the perf_event mmap page rdpmc/time setting was
            broken, dating back to the introduction of the feature.  Due
            to a mistake with a bitfield, two different values mapped to
            the same feature bit.

            A new somewhat backwards compatible interface was introduced
            in Linux 3.12.  A much longer report on the issue can be found
            here:
               https://lwn.net/Articles/567894/
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 adds PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER
            A new PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER sample type was added in Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver
        E2BIG documentation
            The following documents the E2BIG error return for
            perf_event_open().

            I actually ran into this error the hard way and it took me
            half a day to figure out why my ->size value was changing.
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 adds PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID
            A new perf_event related ioctl, PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID, was added
            in Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver
        PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY support
            Support for the PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY event type was added in
            Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver  [Andreas Sandberg]
        PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD update
            The PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD ioctl was broken until 2.6.36,
            and it turns out that the ARM architecture has some
            differing behavior too.

pipe.2
    Trevor Bramwell
        Fix error in example program

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Paolo Bonzini]
        Clarify meaning of events==0
            events==0 does not mean that revents is always returned as
            zero. The "output only" events (POLLHUP, POLLERR, POLLNVAL)
            can still be returned.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61911

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yuanhang Zheng]
        Fix typo in error message in example program

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove out-of-date statement that UNIX domain does not support MSG_TRUNC
            Should have removed that sentence as part of
            commit a25601b48b822eb1882ae336574b8d062a17e564

sched_get_priority_max.2

    Michael Kerrisk
        Note filesystem support for nanosecond timestamps
            Add some detail on which native filesystems do and don't
            support nanosecond timestamps.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Cosmetic reworking of timestamp discussion in NOTES
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yang Yang]
        Update discussion of nanosecond timestamps
            The existing text describes the timestamp fields as 'time_t'
            and delegates discussion of nanosecond timestamps under NOTES.
            Nanosecond timestamps have been around for a while now,
            and are in POSIX.1-2008, so reverse the orientation of the
            discussion, putting the nanosecond fields into DESCRIPTION
            and detailing the historical situation under NOTES.

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Further fine tuning of argument names
            Follow-up to f2ae6dde0c68448bec986d12fe32268a2c98bfd9
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16073

kcmp.3
    Shawn Landden
        Reword slightly awkward section

malloc.3
    Greg Price
        Scale back promises of alignment
            It's not true that the return value is suitably aligned for "any
            variable"; for example, it's unsuitable for a variable like
              float *x __attribute__ ((__vector_size__ (32)));
            which requires 32-byte alignment.  Types like this are defined in
            <avxintrin.h>, and with 16-byte alignment in <emmintrin.h> and
            <xmmintrin.h>, so the application programmer need not even know
            that a vector_size attribute has been applied.

            On an x86 architecture, a program that loads from or stores to a
            pointer with this type derived from malloc can crash because GCC
            generates an aligned load/store, like MOVDQA.

            The C99 standard (TC3, as of N1256) does say the return value is
            suitably aligned for "any type of object".  The C11 standard (as
            of N1570) revises this to any type with "fundamental alignment",
            which means an alignment "supported by the implementation in all
            contexts", which I suppose tautologically includes aligning
            malloc/realloc return values.

            The actual behavior of current glibc malloc is to align to the
            greater of 2 * sizeof(size_t) and __alignof__ (long double),
            which may be one bit greater than this commit promises.

mq_receive.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [janh]

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64571
