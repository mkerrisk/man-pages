.SH NAME
packet, PF_PACKET \- packet interface on device level. 
.SH SYNOPSIS

.br
.B #include <netpacket/packet.h>

.B #include <net/ethernet.h>	/* the L2 protocols */

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Packet sockets are used to receive or send raw packets at the device driver
(OSI Layer 2)
level. They allow the user to implement protocol modules in user space 
on top of the physical layer.

The
.I socket_type
is either 
.B SOCK_RAW 
for raw packets including the link level header or 
.B SOCK_DGRAM
for cooked packets with the link level header removed. The link level
header information is available in a common format in a 
.BR sockaddr_ll . 
.I protocol 
is the IEEE 802.3 protocol number in network order. See the 
.B <linux/if_ether.h> 
include file for a list of allowed protocols. When protocol 
is set to
.B htons(ETH_P_ALL) 
then all protocols are received.
All incoming packets of that protocol type will be passed to the packet
socket before they are passed to the protocols implemented in the kernel.
 
Only processes with effective uid 0 or the
.B CAP_NET_RAW
capability may open packet sockets. 

.B SOCK_RAW
packets are passed to and from the device driver without any changes in
the packet data.  When receiving a packet, the address is still parsed and
passed in a standard
.B sockaddr_ll
address structure.  When transmitting a packet, the user supplied buffer
should contain the physical layer header.  That packet is then
queued unmodified to the network driver of the interface defined by the
destination address. Some device drivers always add other headers. 
.B SOCK_RAW
is similar to but not compatible with the obsolete 
.B SOCK_PACKET
of Linux 2.0.

.B SOCK_DGRAM 
operates on a slightly higher level. The physical header is removed before
the packet is passed to the user.  Packets sent through a
.B SOCK_DGRAM
packet socket get a suitable physical layer header based on the information
in the 
.B sockaddr_ll 
destination address before they are queued.

By default all packets of the specified protocol type
are passed to a packet socket. To only get packets from a specific interface
use
.BR bind (2)
specifying an address in a
.B struct sockaddr_ll
to bind the packet socket to an interface. Only the 
.B sll_protocol 
and the
.B sll_ifindex
address fields are used for purposes of binding.

The
.BR connect (2)
operation is not supported on packet sockets.

When the
.B MSG_TRUNC
flag is passed to
.BR recvmsg (2),
.BR recv (2),
.BR recvfrom (2)
the real length of the packet on the wire is always returned, even when it
is longer than the buffer.

.SH "ADDRESS TYPES"
The sockaddr_ll is a device independent physical layer address.

.RS
.nf
.ta 4n 20n 35n
struct sockaddr_ll {
	unsigned short	sll_family;	/* Always AF_PACKET */
	unsigned short	sll_protocol;	/* Physical layer protocol */
	int	sll_ifindex;	/* Interface number */
	unsigned short	sll_hatype;	/* Header type */	
	unsigned char	sll_pkttype;	/* Packet type */
	unsigned char	sll_halen;	/* Length of address */ 
	unsigned char	sll_addr[8];	/* Physical layer address */
};
.ta
.fi
.RE

.B sll_protocol 
is the standard ethernet protocol type in network order as defined
in the
.B linux/if_ether.h   
include file.  It defaults to the socket's protocol.
.B sll_ifindex 
is the interface index of the interface
(see
.BR netdevice (7));
0 matches any interface (only legal for binding). 
.B sll_hatype 
is a ARP type as defined in the 
.B linux/if_arp.h 
include file.
.B sll_pkttype 
contains the packet type. Valid types are 
.B PACKET_HOST
for a packet addressed to the local host,
.B PACKET_BROADCAST
for a physical layer broadcast packet,
.B PACKET_MULTICAST
for a packet sent to a physical layer multicast address,
.B PACKET_OTHERHOST
for a packet to some other host that has been caught by a device driver
in promiscuous mode, and
.B PACKET_OUTGOING
for a packet originated from the local host that is looped back to a packet
socket. These types make only sense for receiving.
.B sll_addr
and
.B sll_halen
contain the physical layer (e.g. IEEE 802.3) address and its length. The 
exact interpretation depends on the device.

When you send packets it is enough to specify
.BR sll_family ,
.BR sll_addr ,
.BR sll_halen ,
.BR sll_ifindex .
The other fields should be 0.
.B sll_hatype
and
.B sll_pkttype
are set on received packets for your information.
For bind only
.B sll_protocol
and
.B sll_ifindex
are used.

.SH "SOCKET OPTIONS"
Packet sockets can be used to configure physical layer multicasting 
and promiscuous mode. It works by calling 
.BR setsockopt (2) 
on a packet socket for SOL_PACKET and one of the options 
.B PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP 
to add a binding or 
.B PACKET_DROP_MEMBERSHIP
to drop it.
They both expect a 
.B packet_mreq
structure as argument:

.RS
.nf
.ta 4n 20n 35n
struct packet_mreq
{
	int	mr_ifindex;	/* interface index */
	unsigned short	mr_type;	/* action */
	unsigned short	mr_alen;	/* address length */
	unsigned char	mr_address[8];	/* physical layer address */ 
};
.ta
.fi
.RE 

.B mr_ifindex
contains the interface index for the interface whose status
should be changed.
The
.B mr_type
parameter specifies which action to perform.
.B PACKET_MR_PROMISC
enables receiving all packets on a shared medium - often known as
``promiscuous mode'',
.B PACKET_MR_MULTICAST 
binds the socket to the physical layer multicast group specified in 
.B mr_address
and
.BR mr_alen ,
and
.B PACKET_MR_ALLMULTI
sets the socket up to receive all multicast packets arriving at the interface. 

In addition the traditional ioctls 
.B SIOCSIFFLAGS,
.B SIOCADDMULTI, 
.B SIOCDELMULTI
can be used for the same purpose.


.SH IOCTLS
.B SIOCGSTAMP
can be used to receive the time stamp of the last received packet. Argument
is a 
.B struct timeval.

In addition all standard ioctls defined in
.BR netdevice (7)
and 
.BR socket (7)
are valid on packet sockets.

.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
Packet sockets do no error handling other than errors occurred while passing
the packet to the device driver. They don't have the concept of a pending
error.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
In Linux 2.0, the only way to get a packet socket was by calling
.BI "socket(PF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, " protocol )\fR.
This is still supported but strongly deprecated.
The main difference between the two methods is that
.B SOCK_PACKET
uses the old
.B struct sockaddr_pkt
to specify an interface, which doesn't provide physical layer independence.

.RS
.nf
.ta 4n 20n 35n
struct sockaddr_pkt
{
	unsigned short	spkt_family;
	unsigned char	spkt_device[14];
	unsigned short	spkt_protocol;
};
.ta
.fi
.RE

.B spkt_family 
contains 
the device type,
.B spkt_protocol 
is the IEEE 802.3 protocol type as defined in
.B <sys/if_ether.h>
and
.B spkt_device 
is the device name as a null terminated string, e.g. eth0.  

This structure is obsolete and should not be used in new code.

.SH NOTES
For portable programs it is suggested to use 
.B PF_PACKET
via 
.BR pcap (3);
although this only covers a subset of the
.B PF_PACKET
features.

The
.B SOCK_DGRAM
packet sockets make no attempt to create or parse the IEEE 802.2 LLC header
for a IEEE 802.3 frame. 
When 
.B ETH_P_802_3 
is specified as protocol for sending the kernel creates the 
802.3 frame and fills out the length field; the user has to supply the LLC 
header to get a fully conforming packet. Incoming 802.3 packets are not 
multiplexed on the DSAP/SSAP protocol fields; instead they are supplied to the 
user as protocol 
.B ETH_P_802_2
with the LLC header prepended. It is thus not possible to bind to
.B ETH_P_802_3;
bind to 
.B ETH_P_802_2 
instead and do the protocol multiplex yourself.
The default for sending is the standard Ethernet DIX 
encapsulation with the protocol filled in. 

Packet sockets are not subject to the input or output firewall chains.

.SH ERRORS

In addition other errors may be generated by the low-level driver.
.SH VERSIONS
.B PF_PACKET 
is a new feature in Linux 2.2. Earlier Linux versions supported only
.B SOCK_PACKET.

.SH BUGS
glibc 2.1 does not have a define for 
.B SOL_PACKET.
The suggested workaround is to use
.RS
.nf
#ifndef SOL_PACKET
#define SOL_PACKET 263
#endif
.fi
.RE
This is fixed in later glibc versions and also does not occur on libc5 systems.

The IEEE 802.2/803.3 LLC handling could be considered as a bug. 

Socket filters are not documented.

The
.I MSG_TRUNC
recvmsg extension is an ugly hack and should be replaced by a control message.
There is currently no way to get the original destination address of
packets via SOCK_DGRAM.

.SH HISTORICAL NOTE
The include file
.I <netpacket/packet.h>
is present since glibc2.1. Older systems need
.sp
.nf
.B #include <asm/types.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/if_packet.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/if_ether.h>  /* The L2 protocols */
