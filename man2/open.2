.TH OPEN 2 2014-01-20 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
open, creat \- open and possibly create a file or device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.B #include <sys/stat.h>
.B #include <fcntl.h>
.sp
.BI "int open(const char *" pathname ", int " flags );
.BI "int open(const char *" pathname ", int " flags ", mode_t " mode );

.BI "int creat(const char *" pathname ", mode_t " mode );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Given a
.I pathname
for a file,
.BR open ()
returns a file descriptor, a small, nonnegative integer
for use in subsequent system calls
.RB ( read "(2), " write "(2), " lseek "(2), " fcntl "(2), etc.)."
The file descriptor returned by a successful call will be
the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process.
.PP
By default, the new file descriptor is set to remain open across an
.BR execve (2)
(i.e., the
.B FD_CLOEXEC
file descriptor flag described in
.BR fcntl (2)
is initially disabled; the
.B O_CLOEXEC
flag, described below, can be used to change this default).
The file offset is set to the beginning of the file (see
.BR lseek (2)).
.PP
A call to
.BR open ()
creates a new
.IR "open file description" ,
an entry in the system-wide table of open files.
This entry records the file offset and the file status flags
(modifiable via the
.BR fcntl (2)
.B F_SETFL
operation).
A file descriptor is a reference to one of these entries;
this reference is unaffected if
.I pathname
is subsequently removed or modified to refer to a different file.
The new open file description is initially not shared
with any other process,
but sharing may arise via
.BR fork (2).
.PP
The argument
.I flags
must include one of the following
.IR "access modes" :
.BR O_RDONLY ", " O_WRONLY ", or " O_RDWR .
These request opening the file read-only, write-only, or read/write,
respectively.

In addition, zero or more file creation flags and file status flags
can be
.RI bitwise- or 'd
in
.IR flags .
The
.I file creation flags
are
.BR O_CLOEXEC ,
.BR O_CREAT ,
.BR O_DIRECTORY ,
.BR O_EXCL ,
.BR O_NOCTTY ,
.BR O_NOFOLLOW ,
.BR O_TMPFILE ,
.BR O_TRUNC ,
and
.BR O_TTY_INIT .
The
.I file status flags
are all of the remaining flags listed below.
.\" SUSv4 divides the flags into:
.\" * Access mode
.\" * File creation
.\" * File status
.\" * Other (O_CLOEXEC, O_DIRECTORY, O_NOFOLLOW)
.\" though it's not clear what the difference between "other" and
.\" "File creation" flags is.  I raised an Aardvark to see if this
.\" can be clarified in SUSv4; 10 Oct 2008.
.\" http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.standards.posix.austin.general/64/focus=67
.\" TC1 (balloted in 2013), resolved this, so that those three constants
.\" are also categorized" as file status flags.
.\"
The distinction between these two groups of flags is that
the file status flags can be retrieved and (in some cases)
modified using
.BR fcntl (2).
The full list of file creation flags and file status flags is as follows:
.TP
.B O_APPEND
The file is opened in append mode.
Before each
.BR write (2),
the file offset is positioned at the end of the file,
as if with
.BR lseek (2).
.B O_APPEND
may lead to corrupted files on NFS filesystems if more than one process
appends data to a file at once.
.\" For more background, see
.\" http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=453946
.\" http://nfs.sourceforge.net/
This is because NFS does not support
appending to a file, so the client kernel has to simulate it, which
can't be done without a race condition.
.TP
.B O_ASYNC
Enable signal-driven I/O:
generate a signal
.RB ( SIGIO
by default, but this can be changed via
.BR fcntl (2))
when input or output becomes possible on this file descriptor.
This feature is available only for terminals, pseudoterminals,
sockets, and (since Linux 2.6) pipes and FIFOs.
See
.BR fcntl (2)
for further details.
.TP
.BR O_CLOEXEC " (since Linux 2.6.23)"
Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new file descriptor.
Specifying this flag permits a program to avoid additional
.BR fcntl (2)
.B F_SETFD
operations to set the
.B FD_CLOEXEC
flag.
Additionally,
use of this flag is essential in some multithreaded programs
since using a separate
.BR fcntl (2)
.B F_SETFD
operation to set the
.B FD_CLOEXEC
flag does not suffice to avoid race conditions
where one thread opens a file descriptor at the same
time as another thread does a
.BR fork (2)
plus
.BR execve (2).
.\" This flag fixes only one form of the race condition;
.\" The race can also occur with, for example, descriptors
.\" returned by accept(), pipe(), etc.
.TP
.B O_CREAT
If the file does not exist it will be created.
The owner (user ID) of the file is set to the effective user ID
of the process.
The group ownership (group ID) is set either to
the effective group ID of the process or to the group ID of the
parent directory (depending on filesystem type and mount options,
and the mode of the parent directory, see the mount options
.I bsdgroups
and
.I sysvgroups
described in
.BR mount (8)).
.\" As at 2.6.25, bsdgroups is supported by ext2, ext3, ext4, and
.\" XFS (since 2.6.14).
.RS
.PP
.I mode
specifies the permissions to use in case a new file is created.
This argument must be supplied when
.B O_CREAT
or
.B O_TMPFILE
is specified in
.IR flags ;
if neither
.B O_CREAT
nor
.B O_TMPFILE
is specified, then
.I mode
is ignored.
The effective permissions are modified by
the process's
.I umask
in the usual way: The permissions of the created file are
.IR "(mode\ &\ ~umask)" .
Note that this mode applies only to future accesses of the
newly created file; the
.BR open ()
call that creates a read-only file may well return a read/write
file descriptor.
.PP
The following symbolic constants are provided for
.IR mode :
.TP 9
.B S_IRWXU
00700 user (file owner) has read, write and execute permission
.TP
.B S_IRUSR
00400 user has read permission

.\" commit bb458c644a59dbba3a1fe59b27106c5e68e1c4bd
Create an unnamed temporary file.
The
.I pathname
argument specifies a directory;
an unnamed inode will be created in that directory's filesystem.
Anything written to the resulting file will be lost when
the last file descriptor is closed, unless the file is given a name.

.B O_TMPFILE
must be specified with one of
.B O_RDWR
or
.B O_WRONLY
and, optionally,
.BR O_EXCL .
If
.B O_EXCL
is not specified, then
.BR linkat (2)
can be used to link the temporary file into the filesystem, making it
permanent, using code like the following:

.in +4n
.nf
char path[PATH_MAX];
fd = open("/path/to/dir", O_TMPFILE | O_RDWR,
        S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
/* File I/O on 'fd'... */
snprintf(path, PATH_MAX,  "/proc/self/fd/%d", fd);
linkat(AT_FDCWD, path, AT_FDCWD, argv[2],
        AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW);
.fi
.in

In this case,
the
.BR open ()
.I mode
argument determines the file permission mode, as with
.BR O_CREAT .

There are two main use cases for
.\" Inspired by http://lwn.net/Articles/559147/
.BR O_TMPFILE :
.RS
.IP * 3
Improved
.BR tmpfile (3)
functionality: race-free creation of temporary files that
(1) are automatically deleted when closed;
(2) can never be reached via any pathname;
(3) are not subject to symlink attacks; and
(4) do not require the caller to devise unique names.
.IP *
Creating a file that is initially invisible, which is then populated
with data and adjusted to have approriate filesystem attributes
.RB ( chown (2),
.BR chmod (2),
.BR fsetxattr (2),
etc.)
before being atomically linked into the filesystem
in a fully formed state (using
.BR linkat (2)
as described above).
.RE
.IP
.B O_TMPFILE
requires support by the underlying filesystem;
.\" As at 3.13, there's support for at least ext2, ext3, ext4

.TP
.BR O_DIRECT " (since Linux 2.4.10)"
Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and from this file.
In general this will degrade performance, but it is useful in
special situations, such as when applications do their own caching.
File I/O is done directly to/from user-space buffers.
The
.B O_DIRECT
flag on its own makes an effort to transfer data synchronously,
but does not give the guarantees of the
.B O_SYNC
flag that data and necessary metadata are transferred.
To guarantee synchronous I/O,
.B O_SYNC
must be used in addition to
.BR O_DIRECT .
See NOTES below for further discussion.
.sp
A semantically similar (but deprecated) interface for block devices
is described in
.BR raw (8).
.TP
.B O_DIRECTORY
If \fIpathname\fP is not a directory, cause the open to fail.
.\" But see the following and its replies:
.\" http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112748702800001&r=1&w=2
.\" [PATCH] open: O_DIRECTORY and O_CREAT together should fail
.\" O_DIRECTORY | O_CREAT causes O_DIRECTORY to be ignored.
This flag is Linux-specific, and was added in kernel version 2.1.126, to
avoid denial-of-service problems if
.BR opendir (3)
is called on a
FIFO or tape device.
.TP
.B O_EXCL
Ensure that this call creates the file:
if this flag is specified in conjunction with
.BR O_CREAT ,
and
.I pathname
already exists, then
.BR open ()
will fail.

When these two flags are specified, symbolic links are not followed:
.\" POSIX.1-2001 explicitly requires this behavior.
if
.I pathname
is a symbolic link, then
.BR open ()
fails regardless of where the symbolic link points to.

In general, the behavior of
.B O_EXCL
is undefined if it is used without
.BR O_CREAT .
There is one exception: on Linux 2.6 and later,
.B O_EXCL
can be used without
.B O_CREAT
if
.I pathname
refers to a block device.
If the block device is in use by the system (e.g., mounted),
.BR open ()
fails with the error
.BR EBUSY .

On NFS,
.B O_EXCL
is supported only when using NFSv3 or later on kernel 2.6 or later.
In NFS environments where
.B O_EXCL
support is not provided, programs that rely on it
for performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.
Portable programs that want to perform atomic file locking using a lockfile,
and need to avoid reliance on NFS support for
.BR O_EXCL ,
can create a unique file on
the same filesystem (e.g., incorporating hostname and PID), and use
.BR link (2)
to make a link to the lockfile.
If
.BR link (2)
returns 0, the lock is successful.
Otherwise, use
.BR stat (2)
on the unique file to check if its link count has increased to 2,
in which case the lock is also successful.
.TP
.B O_LARGEFILE
(LFS)
Allow files whose sizes cannot be represented in an
.I off_t
(but can be represented in an
.IR off64_t )
to be opened.
The
.B _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
macro must be defined
(before including
.I any
header files)
in order to obtain this definition.
Setting the
.B _FILE_OFFSET_BITS
feature test macro to 64 (rather than using
.BR O_LARGEFILE )
is the preferred
method of accessing large files on 32-bit systems (see
.BR feature_test_macros (7)).
.TP
.BR O_NOATIME " (since Linux 2.6.8)"
Do not update the file last access time
.RI ( st_atime
in the inode)
when the file is
.BR read (2).
This flag is intended for use by indexing or backup programs,
where its use can significantly reduce the amount of disk activity.
This flag may not be effective on all filesystems.
One example is NFS, where the server maintains the access time.
.\" The O_NOATIME flag also affects the treatment of st_atime
.\" by mmap() and readdir(2), MTK, Dec 04.
.TP
.B O_NOCTTY
If

refers to a terminal device\(emsee
.BR tty (4)\(emit

process does not have one.
.TP
.B O_NOFOLLOW
If \fIpathname\fP is a symbolic link, then the open fails.
This is a FreeBSD extension, which was added to Linux in version 2.1.126.
Symbolic links in earlier components of the pathname will still be
followed.
See also
.BR O_PATH
below.
.\" The headers from glibc 2.0.100 and later include a
.\" definition of this flag; \fIkernels before 2.1.126 will ignore it if
.\" used\fP.
.TP
.BR O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
When possible, the file is opened in nonblocking mode.
Neither the
.BR open ()
nor any subsequent operations on the file descriptor which is
returned will cause the calling process to wait.
For the handling of FIFOs (named pipes), see also
.BR fifo (7).

.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
The
.BR O_DIRECTORY ,
.BR O_NOATIME ,
.BR O_NOFOLLOW ,
and
.BR O_PATH
flags are Linux-specific, and one may need to define
.B _GNU_SOURCE
(before including
.I any
header files)
to obtain their definitions.

The
.BR O_CLOEXEC
flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001,
but is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

.B O_DIRECT
is not specified in POSIX; one has to define
.B _GNU_SOURCE
(before including
.I any
header files)
to get its definition.
.SH NOTES
Under Linux, the
.B O_NONBLOCK
flag indicates that one wants to open
but does not necessarily have the intention to read or write.
This is typically used to open devices in order to get a file descriptor
for use with
.BR ioctl (2).

Unlike the other values that can be specified in
.IR flags ,
the
.I "access mode"
values
.BR O_RDONLY ", " O_WRONLY ", and " O_RDWR ,
do not specify individual bits.
Rather, they define the low order two bits of
.IR flags ,
and are defined respectively as 0, 1, and 2.
In other words, the combination
.B "O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY"
is a logical error, and certainly does not have the same meaning as
.BR O_RDWR .
Linux reserves the special, nonstandard access mode 3 (binary 11) in
.I flags
to mean:
check for read and write permission on the file and return a descriptor
that can't be used for reading or writing.
This nonstandard access mode is used by some Linux drivers to return a
descriptor that is to be used only for device-specific
.BR ioctl (2)
operations.

The (undefined) effect of

.PP
There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS, affecting
amongst others
.BR O_SYNC " and " O_NDELAY .

POSIX provides for three different variants of synchronized I/O,
corresponding to the flags
.BR O_SYNC ,
.BR O_DSYNC ,
and
.BR O_RSYNC .
Currently (2.6.31), Linux implements only
.BR O_SYNC ,
but glibc maps
.B O_DSYNC
and
.B O_RSYNC
to the same numerical value as
.BR O_SYNC .
Most Linux filesystems don't actually implement the POSIX
.B O_SYNC
semantics, which require all metadata updates of a write
to be on disk on returning to user space, but only the
.B O_DSYNC
semantics, which require only actual file data and metadata necessary
to retrieve it to be on disk by the time the system call returns.

Note that
.BR open ()
can open device special files, but
.BR creat ()
cannot create them; use
.BR mknod (2)
instead.
.LP
On NFS filesystems with UID mapping enabled,
.BR open ()
may
return a file descriptor but, for example,
.BR read (2)
requests are denied
with \fBEACCES\fP.
This is because the client performs
.BR open ()
by checking the
permissions, but UID mapping is performed by the server upon
read and write requests.

If the file is newly created, its
.IR st_atime ,
.IR st_ctime ,
.I st_mtime
fields
(respectively, time of last access, time of last status change, and
time of last modification; see
.BR stat (2))
are set
to the current time, and so are the
.I st_ctime
and
.I st_mtime
fields of the
parent directory.
Otherwise, if the file is modified because of the
.B O_TRUNC
flag, its st_ctime and st_mtime fields are set to the current time.
.SS O_DIRECT
.LP
The
.B O_DIRECT
flag may impose alignment restrictions on the length and address
of user-space buffers and the file offset of I/Os.
In Linux alignment
restrictions vary by filesystem and kernel version and might be
absent entirely.
However there is currently no filesystem\-independent
interface for an application to discover these restrictions for a given
file or filesystem.
Some filesystems provide their own interfaces
for doing so, for example the
.B XFS_IOC_DIOINFO
operation in
.BR xfsctl (3).
.LP
Under Linux 2.4, transfer sizes, and the alignment of the user buffer
and the file offset must all be multiples of the logical block size
of the filesystem.
Under Linux 2.6, alignment to 512-byte boundaries suffices.
.LP
.B O_DIRECT
I/Os should never be run concurrently with the
.BR fork (2)
system call,
if the memory buffer is a private mapping
(i.e., any mapping created with the
.BR mmap (2)
.BR MAP_PRIVATE
flag;
this includes memory allocated on the heap and statically allocated buffers).
Any such I/Os, whether submitted via an asynchronous I/O interface or from
another thread in the process,
should be completed before
.BR fork (2)
is called.
Failure to do so can result in data corruption and undefined behavior in
parent and child processes.
This restriction does not apply when the memory buffer for the
.B O_DIRECT
I/Os was created using
.BR shmat (2)
or
.BR mmap (2)
with the
.B MAP_SHARED
flag.
Nor does this restriction apply when the memory buffer has been advised as
.B MADV_DONTFORK
with
.BR madvise (2),
ensuring that it will not be available
to the child after
.BR fork (2).
.LP
The
.B O_DIRECT
flag was introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment
restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4.
IRIX has also a
.BR fcntl (2)
call to query appropriate alignments, and sizes.
FreeBSD 4.x introduced
a flag of the same name, but without alignment restrictions.
.LP
.B O_DIRECT
support was added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10.
Older Linux kernels simply ignore this flag.
Some filesystems may not implement the flag and
.BR open ()
will fail with
.B EINVAL
if it is used.
.LP
Applications should avoid mixing
.B O_DIRECT
and normal I/O to the same file,
and especially to overlapping byte regions in the same file.
Even when the filesystem correctly handles the coherency issues in
this situation, overall I/O throughput is likely to be slower than
using either mode alone.
Likewise, applications should avoid mixing
.BR mmap (2)
of files with direct I/O to the same files.
.LP
The behaviour of
.B O_DIRECT
with NFS will differ from local filesystems.
Older kernels, or
kernels configured in certain ways, may not support this combination.
The NFS protocol does not support passing the flag to the server, so
.B O_DIRECT
I/O will bypass the page cache only on the client; the server may
still cache the I/O.
The client asks the server to make the I/O
synchronous to preserve the synchronous semantics of
.BR O_DIRECT .
Some servers will perform poorly under these circumstances, especially
if the I/O size is small.
Some servers may also be configured to
lie to clients about the I/O having reached stable storage; this
will avoid the performance penalty at some risk to data integrity
in the event of server power failure.
The Linux NFS client places no alignment restrictions on
.B O_DIRECT
I/O.
.PP
In summary,
.B O_DIRECT
is a potentially powerful tool that should be used with caution.
It is recommended that applications treat use of
.B O_DIRECT
as a performance option which is disabled by default.
.PP
.RS
"The thing that has always disturbed me about O_DIRECT is that the whole
interface is just stupid, and was probably designed by a deranged monkey
on some serious mind-controlling substances."\(emLinus

Currently, it is not possible to enable signal-driven
I/O by specifying
.B O_ASYNC

.BR open ();
use
.BR fcntl (2)
to enable this flag.
