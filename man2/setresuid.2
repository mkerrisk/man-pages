.TH SETRESUID 2 2003-05-26 "Linux 2.4" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
setresuid, setresgid \- set real, effective and saved user or group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #define _GNU_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int setresuid(uid_t " ruid ", uid_t " euid ", uid_t " suid );
.br
.BI "int setresgid(gid_t " rgid ", gid_t " egid ", gid_t " sgid ); 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B setresuid
sets the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the saved
(effective) user ID of the current process.

Unprivileged user processes (i.e., processes with each of
real, effective and saved user ID nonzero) may change the real,
effective and saved user ID, each to one of:
the current uid, the current effective uid or the current saved uid.

The super-user may set real, effective and saved user ID to arbitrary values.

If one of the parameters equals \-1, the corresponding value is not changed.

Completely analogously,
.B setresgid
sets the real, effective and saved group ID's of the current process,
with the same restrictions for processes with each of
real, effective and saved user ID nonzero.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EAGAIN
.I uid
does not match the current uid and this call would
bring that userID over its NPROC rlimit.
.TP
.B EPERM
The current process was not privileged (did not have the CAP_SETUID
capability) and tried to change the IDs is a not allowed way.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This call is nonstandard.
.SH HISTORY
This system call was first introduced in HP-UX.
It is available under Linux since Linux 2.1.44.
These days it is also found in FreeBSD (for emulation of Linux binaries).
.SH NOTES
Under HP-UX and FreeBSD the prototype is found in
.IR <unistd.h> .
Under Linux the prototype is given by glibc since version 2.3.2
provided _GNU_SOURCE is defined.
