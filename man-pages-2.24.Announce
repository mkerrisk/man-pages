RELEASE
The Linux man page maintainer proudly announces. . .

    man-pages-2.2?.tar.gz - man pages for Linux

Differences from the previous manual pages release are listed in
the file "Changes".

POSIX
This release contains a copy of the POSIX 1003.1-2003 man pages.
The directories man0p, man1p, man3p contain descriptions of the
headers, the utilities, and the functions documented in that standard.
For the copyright notice, see the file POSIX-COPYRIGHT.

In order to use this, put in {/usr/share/misc/}man.conf{ig} or so
your favourite order of looking at these pages, for example,
MANSECT         1p:1:8:0p:3p:2:3:4:5:6:7:9:tcl:n:l:p:o
or set the MANSECT environment variable.

OTHER PAGES
The remaining pages are most of the section 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 man pages
for Linux, and in addition section 1 man pages for the fileutils-4.0
utilities, and section 5 and 8 man pages for the timezone utilities.

[The latter were taken from ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2001a.tar.gz.]
[The section 3 man pages for the db routines have been taken from
ftp://ftp.terra.net/pub/sleepycat/db.1.86.tar.gz.]
[The rpc man pages were taken from the 4.4BSD-Lite CDROM.]

Here is a breakdown of what this distribution contains:

    Section 0p = POSIX headers
    Section 1p = POSIX utilities
    Section 3p = POSIX functions

    Section 1 = user commands (intro, and pages not maintained by FSF)
    Section 2 = system calls
    Section 3 = libc calls
    Section 4 = devices (e.g., hd, sd)
    Section 5 = file formats and protocols (e.g., wtmp, /etc/passwd, nfs)
    Section 6 = games (intro only)
    Section 7 = conventions, macro packages, etc.
    Section 8 = system administration (intro only)

    Usually, there are no section 1, 6 and 8 man pages because these
    should be distributed with the binaries they are written for.
    Sometimes Section 9 is used for man pages describing parts of the kernel.

    Note that only Section 2 is rather complete, but Section 3 contains
    several hundred man pages.  If you want to write some man pages,
    please do so and mail them to mtk-manpages@gmx.net.
