.SH NAME
difftime \- calculate time difference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <time.h>
.sp
.BI "double difftime(time_t " time1 ", time_t " time0 );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR difftime ()
function returns the number of seconds elapsed
between time \fItime1\fP and time \fItime0\fP, represented as a
.IR double .
Each of the times is specified in calendar time, which means its
value is a measurement (in seconds) relative to the Epoch,
1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.
.SH NOTES
On a POSIX system,
.I time_t
is an arithmetic type, and one could just
define
.RS
.nf

#define difftime(t1,t0) (double)(t1 \- t0)

.fi
.RE
when the possible overflow in the subtraction is not a concern.
On other systems, the data type
.I time_t
might use some other encoding
where subtraction doesn't work directly.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR date (1),
.BR gettimeofday (2),
.BR time (2),
.BR ctime (3),
.BR gmtime (3),
.BR localtime (3)
