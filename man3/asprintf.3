.TH ASPRINTF 3 2001-12-18 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
asprintf, vasprintf \- print to allocated string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #define _GNU_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "int asprintf(char **" strp ", const char *" fmt ", ...);"
.sp
.BI "int vasprintf(char **" strp ", const char *" fmt ", va_list " ap );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions
.B asprintf
and
.B vasprintf
are analogues of
.B sprintf
and
.BR vsprintf ,
except that they allocate a string large enough to hold the output
including the terminating NUL,
and return a pointer to it via the first parameter.
This pointer should be passed to
.BR free (3)
to release the allocated storage when it is no longer needed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
When successful, these functions return the number of bytes printed,
just like
.BR sprintf (3).
If memory allocation wasn't possible, or some other error occurs,
these functions will return \-1, and the contents of
.I strp
is undefined.
.SH NOTES
These functions are GNU extensions, not in C or POSIX.
They are also available under *BSD.
The FreeBSD implementation sets
.I strp
to NULL on error.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR free (3),
.BR malloc (3),
.BR printf (3)
