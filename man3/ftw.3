.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <ftw.h>

.BI "int ftw(const char *" dir ", int (*" fn ")(const"
.BI "char *" file ", const struct stat *" sb ", int " flag ),
.BI "int " nopenfd );

.BI "int nftw(const char *" dir ", int (*" fn ")(const"
.BI "char *" file ", const struct stat *" sb ", int " flag ,
.BI "struct FTW *" s ),
.BI "int " nopenfd ", int " flags );
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBftw\fP() walks through the directory tree starting from the indicated
directory \fIdir\fP.  For each found entry in the tree, it calls
\fIfn\fP() with the full pathname of the entry, a pointer to the
.BR stat (2)
structure for the entry and an int \fIflag\fP, which value will be one of
the following:
.TP
.B FTW_F
Item is a normal file
.TP
.B FTW_D
Item is a directory
.TP
.B FTW_DNR
Item is a directory which can't be read
.TP
.B FTW_SL
Item is a symbolic link
.TP
.B FTW_NS
The stat failed on the item which is not a symbolic link
.LP
If the item is a symbolic link and stat failed, XPG4v2 states
that it is undefined whether FTW_NS or FTW_SL is used.
.PP
\fBftw\fP() recursively calls itself for traversing found directories,
handling a directory before its files or subdirectories.
To avoid using up all a program's file descriptors, \fInopenfd\fP
specifies the maximum number of simultaneous open directories.  When
the search depth exceeds this, \fBftw\fP() will become slower because
directories have to be closed and reopened. \fBftw\fP() uses at most
one file descriptor for each level in the file hierarchy.
.PP
To stop the tree walk, \fIfn\fP() returns a non-zero value; this
value will become the return value of \fBftw\fP().  Otherwise,
\fBftw\fP() will continue until it has traversed the entire tree, in
which case it will return zero, or until it hits an error other than EACCES
(such as a
.BR malloc (3)
failure), in which case it will return \-1.
.PP
Because \fBftw()\fP uses dynamic data structures, the only safe way to
exit out of a tree walk is to return a non-zero value.  To handle
interrupts, for example, mark that the interrupt occurred and return a
non-zero value\(emdon't use
.BR longjmp (3)
unless the program is going to terminate.

The function \fBnftw\fP() does precisely the same as \fBftw\fP(),
except that it has one additional argument \fIflags\fP
(and calls the supplied function with one more argument).
This \fIflags\fP argument is an OR of zero or more of the following flags:
.TP
.B FTW_CHDIR
If set, do a
.IR chdir ()
to each directory before handling its contents.
.TP
.B FTW_DEPTH
If set, do a depth-first search, that is, call the function for
the directory itself only after handling the contents of the directory
and its subdirectories.
.TP
.B FTW_MOUNT
If set, stay within the same file system.
.TP
.B FTW_PHYS
If set, do not follow symbolic links.
(This is what you want.)
If not set, symbolic links are followed, but no file is reported twice.
.LP
If FTW_PHYS is not set, but FTW_DEPTH is set, then the function
.IR fn ()
is never called for a directory that would be a descendant of itself.
.LP
The function
.IR fn ()
is called with four arguments: the pathname of the reported entry,
a pointer to a struct stat for this entry, an integer describing
its type, and a pointer to a struct FTW. The type will be one
of the following: FTW_F, FTW_D, FTW_DNR, FTW_SL, FTW_NS
(with meaning as above; FTW_SL occurs only with FTW_PHYS set) or
.TP
.B FTW_DP
Item is a directory and all its descendants have been handled
already. (This occurs only with FTW_DEPTH set.)
.TP
.B FTW_SLN
Item is a symbolic link pointing to a nonexisting file.
(This occurs only with FTW_PHYS unset.)
.LP
The struct FTW pointed to by the fourth argument to
.IR fn ()
has at least the fields
.IR base ,
the offset of the item's filename in the pathname
given as first argument of
.IR fn (),
and
.IR level ,
the depth of the item relative to the starting point
(which has depth 0).
.SH NOTES
The function
.IR nftw ()
and the use of FTW_SL with
.IR ftw ()
were introduced in XPG4v2.
.LP
On some systems
.IR ftw ()
will never use FTW_SL, on other systems FTW_SL occurs only
for symbolic links that do not point to an existing file,
and again on other systems
.IR ftw ()
will use FTW_SL for each symbolic link. For predictable control, use
.IR nftw ().
.LP
Under Linux, libc4 and libc5 and glibc 2.0.6 will
use FTW_F for all objects (files, symbolic links, fifos, etc)
that can be stat'ed but are not a directory.
The function
.IR nftw ()
is available since glibc 2.1.
