.TH "THREAD KEYRING" 7 "20 Feb 2014" Linux "Kernel key management"
.\"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.SH NAME
thread_keyring \- Per-thread keyring
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B thread keyring
is a keyring used to anchor keys on behalf of a process.  It is only created
when a thread requests it.
.P
A special serial number value, \fBKEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING\fP, is defined that
can be used in lieu of the calling thread's thread keyring's actual serial
number.
.P
From the keyctl utility, '\fB@t\fP' can be used instead of a numeric key ID in
much the same way, but as keyctl is a program run after forking, this is of no
utility.
.P
Thread keyrings are not inherited across clone() and are cleared by execve().
A thread keyring is destroyed when the thread that refers to it exits.
.P
If a thread doesn't have a thread keyring when it is accessed, then the thread
keyring will be created if the keyring is to be modified, otherwise error
ENOKEY will be issued.
