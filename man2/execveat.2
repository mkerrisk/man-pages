.TH EXECVEAT 2 2014-04-02 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
execveat \- execute program relative to a directory file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int execveat(int " fd ", const char *" pathname ","
.br
.BI "             char *const " argv "[],  char *const " envp "[],"
.br
.BI "             int " flags);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR execveat ()
system call executes the program pointed to by the combination of \fIfd\fP and \fIpathname\fP.
The
.BR execveat ()
system call operates in exactly the same way as
.BR execve (2),
except for the differences described in this manual page.

If the pathname given in
.I pathname
is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory
referred to by the file descriptor
.I fd
(rather than relative to the current working directory of
the calling process, as is done by
.BR execve (2)
for a relative pathname).

If
.I pathname
is relative and
.I fd
is the special value
.BR AT_FDCWD ,
then
.I pathname
is interpreted relative to the current working
directory of the calling process (like
.BR execve (2)).

If
.I pathname
is absolute, then
.I fd
is ignored.

If
.I pathname
is an empty string and the
.BR AT_EMPTY_PATH
flag is specified, then the file descriptor
.I fd
specifies the file to be executed.

.I flags
can either be 0, or include the following flags:
.TP
.BR AT_EMPTY_PATH
If
.I pathname
is an empty string, operate on the file referred to by
.IR fd
(which may have been obtained using the
.BR open (2)
.B O_PATH
flag).
.TP
.B AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
If the file identified by
.I fd
and a non-NULL
.I pathname
is a symbolic link, then the call fails with the error
.BR EINVAL .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.BR execveat ()
does not return. On error \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
The same errors that occur for
.BR execve (2)
can also occur for
.BR execveat ().
The following additional errors can occur for
.BR execveat ():
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The program identified by \fIfd\fP and \fIpathname\fP requires the
use of an interpreter program (such as a script starting with
"#!") but the file descriptor
.I fd
was opened with the
.B O_CLOEXEC
flag and so the program file is inaccessible to the launched interpreter.
.TP
.B EINVAL
Invalid flag specified in
.IR flags .
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
.I pathname
is relative and
.I fd
is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR execveat ()
was added to Linux in kernel 3.???.
.SH NOTES
In addition to the reasons explained in
.BR openat (2),
the
.BR execveat ()
system call is also needed to allow
.BR fexecve (3)
to be implemented on systems that do not have the
.I /proc
filesystem mounted.
