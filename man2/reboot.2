.TH REBOOT 2 2004-05-27 "Linux 2.6.6" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
reboot \- reboot or enable/disable Ctrl-Alt-Del
.SH SYNOPSIS
For libc4 and libc5 the library call and the system call are identical,
and since kernel version 2.1.30 there are symbolic names
LINUX_REBOOT_* for the constants and a fourth argument to the call:
.sp
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/reboot.h>
.sp
.BI "int reboot(int " magic ", int " magic2 ", int " flag ", void *" arg );
.sp
Under glibc some of the constants involved have gotten symbolic names RB_*,
and the library call is a 1-argument wrapper around the 3-argument
system call:
.sp
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/reboot.h>
.sp
.BI "int reboot(int " flag );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B reboot
call reboots the system, or enables/disables the reboot keystroke
(abbreviated CAD, since the default is Ctrl-Alt-Delete;
it can be changed using
.BR loadkeys (1)).
.PP
This system call will fail (with EINVAL) unless
.I magic
equals LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1 (that is, 0xfee1dead) and
.I magic2
equals LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2 (that is, 672274793).
However, since 2.1.17 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2A (that is, 85072278)
and since 2.1.97 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2B (that is, 369367448)
and since 2.5.71 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2C (that is, 537993216)
are permitted as value for
.IR magic2 .
(The hexadecimal values of these constants are meaningful.)
The
.I flag
argument can have the following values:
.TP
.B LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART
(RB_AUTOBOOT, 0x1234567).
The message `Restarting system.' is printed, and a default
restart is performed immediately.
If not preceded by a
.BR sync (2),
data will be lost.
.TP
.B LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_HALT
(RB_HALT_SYSTEM, 0xcdef0123; since 1.1.76).
The message `System halted.' is printed, and the system is halted.
Control is given to the ROM monitor, if there is one.
If not preceded by a
.BR sync (2),
data will be lost.
.TP
.B LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF
(0x4321fedc; since 2.1.30).
The message `Power down.' is printed, the system is stopped,
and all power is removed from the system, if possible.
If not preceded by a
.BR sync (2),
data will be lost.
.TP
.B LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2
(0xa1b2c3d4; since 2.1.30).
The message `Restarting system with command '%s'' is printed,
and a restart (using the command string given in
.IR arg )
is performed immediately.
If not preceded by a
.BR sync (2),
data will be lost.
.TP
.B LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_ON
(RB_ENABLE_CAD, 0x89abcdef).
CAD is enabled.
This means that the CAD keystroke will immediately cause
the action associated to LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART.
.TP
.B LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_OFF
(RB_DISABLE_CAD, 0).
CAD is disabled.
This means that the CAD keystroke will cause a SIGINT signal to be
sent to init (process 1), whereupon this process may decide upon a
proper action (maybe: kill all processes, sync, reboot).
.LP
Only the super-user may use this function.
.LP
The precise effect of the above actions depends on the architecture.
For the i386 architecture, the additional argument does not do
anything at present (2.1.122), but the type of reboot can be
determined by kernel command line arguments (`reboot=...') to be
either warm or cold, and either hard or through the BIOS.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
Problem with getting userspace data under LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2.
.TP
.B EINVAL
Bad magic numbers or \fIflag\fP.
.TP
.B EPERM
The calling process has insufficient privilege to call 
.BR reboot ;
the
.B CAP_SYS_BOOT
capability is required.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.B reboot
is Linux specific, and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR sync (2),
.BR bootparam (7),
.BR capabilities (7),
.BR ctrlaltdel (8),
.BR halt (8),
