.TH CHMOD 2 2004-06-23 "Linux 2.6.7" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
chmod, fchmod \- change permissions of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/stat.h>
.sp
.BI "int chmod(const char *" path ", mode_t " mode );
.br
.BI "int fchmod(int " fildes ", mode_t " mode );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The mode of the file given by
.I path
or referenced by
.I fildes
is changed.

Modes are specified by
.IR or'ing
the following:
.RS
.sp
.TP 1.0i
S_ISUID
04000 set user ID on execution
.TP
S_ISGID
02000 set group ID on execution
.TP
S_ISVTX
01000 sticky bit
.TP
S_IRUSR (S_IREAD)
00400 read by owner
.TP
S_IWUSR (S_IWRITE)
00200 write by owner
.TP
S_IXUSR (S_IEXEC)
00100 execute/search by owner
.TP
S_IRGRP
00040 read by group
.TP
S_IWGRP
00020 write by group
.TP
S_IXGRP
00010 execute/search by group
.TP
S_IROTH
00004 read by others
.TP
S_IWOTH
00002 write by others
.TP
S_IXOTH
00001 execute/search by others
.sp
.RE

The effective UID of the calling process must match the owner of the file,
or the process must be privileged (Linux: it must have the
.B CAP_FOWNER
capability).

If the calling process is not privileged (Linux: does not have the
.B CAP_FSETID
capability), and the group of the file does not match
the effective group ID of the process or one of its
supplementary group IDs, the S_ISGID bit will be turned off,
but this will not cause an error to be returned.

As a security measure, depending on the file system,
the set user ID and set group ID execution bits
may be turned off if a file is written.
(On Linux this occurs if the writing process does not have the
.B CAP_FSETID
capability.)
On some file systems, only the super-user can set the sticky bit,
which may have a special meaning.
For the sticky bit, and for set user ID and set group ID bits on
directories, see
.BR stat (2).

On NFS file systems, restricting the permissions will immediately influence
already open files, because the access control is done on the server, but
open files are maintained by the client.  Widening the permissions may be
delayed for other clients if attribute caching is enabled on them.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
Depending on the file system, other errors can be returned.  The more
general errors for
.B chmod
are listed below:

.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
(See also
.BR path_resolution (2).)
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I path
points outside your accessible address space.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
.IR path .
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.I path
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The file does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.TP
.B EPERM
The effective UID does not match the owner of the file,
and the process is not privileged (Linux: it does not have the
.B CAP_FOWNER
capability).
.TP
.B EROFS
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
.PP
The general errors for
.B fchmod
are listed below:
.TP
.B EBADF
The file descriptor
.I fildes
is not valid.
.TP
.B EIO
See above.
.TP
.B EPERM
See above.
.TP
.B EROFS
See above.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.B chmod
call conforms to SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, 4.4BSD.
SVr4 documents EINTR, ENOLINK and EMULTIHOP returns, but no
ENOMEM.  POSIX.1 does not document EFAULT, ENOMEM, ELOOP or EIO error
conditions, or the macros \fBS_IREAD\fP, \fBS_IWRITE\fP and \fBS_IEXEC\fP.
.PP
The 
.B fchmod
call conforms to 4.4BSD and SVr4.
SVr4 documents additional EINTR and ENOLINK error conditions.
POSIX requires the
.B fchmod
function if at least one of
.B _POSIX_MAPPED_FILES
and
.B _POSIX_SHARED_MEMORY_OBJECTS
is defined, and documents additional ENOSYS and EINVAL error
conditions, but does not document EIO.

.BR execve (2),
.BR open (2),
.BR path_resolution (2),
.BR stat (2)
