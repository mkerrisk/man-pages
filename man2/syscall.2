.SH NAME
syscall \- indirect system call
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.B #include <unistd.h>
.BR "#include <sys/syscall.h>   "  "/* For SYS_xxx definitions */"

.BI "int syscall(int " number ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR syscall ()
is a small library function that invokes
the system call whose assembly language
interface has the specified
.I number
with the specified arguments.
Employing
.BR syscall ()
is useful, for example,
when invoking a system call that has no wrapper function in the C library.

.BR syscall ()
saves CPU registers before making the system call,
restores the registers upon return from the system call,
and stores any error code returned by the system call in
.BR errno (3)
if an error occurs.

Symbolic constants for system call numbers can be found in the header file
.IR <sys/syscall.h> .
.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value is defined by the system call being invoked.
In general, a 0 return value indicates success.
A \-1 return value indicates an error,
and an error code is stored in
.IR errno .
.SH NOTES
.BR syscall ()
first appeared in
4BSD.
.SS Architecture-specific requirements
Each architecture ABI has its own requirements on how
system call arguments are passed to the kernel.
For system calls that have a glibc wrapper (e.g., most system calls),
glibc handles the details of copying arguments to the right registers
in a manner suitable for the architecture.
However, when using
.BR syscall ()
to make a system call,
the caller might need to handle architecture-dependent details;
this requirement is most commonly encountered on certain 32-bit architectures.

For example, on the ARM architecture Embedded ABI (EABI), a
64-bit value (e.g.,
.IR "long long" )
must be aligned to an even register pair.
Thus, using
.BR syscall ()
instead of the wrapper provided by glibc,
the
.BR readahead ()
system call would be invoked as follows on the ARM architecture with the EABI:

.in +4n
.nf
syscall(SYS_readahead, fd, 0,
        (unsigned int) (offset >> 32),
        (unsigned int) (offset & 0xFFFFFFFF),
        count);
.fi
.in
.PP
Since the offset argument is 64 bits, and the first argument
.RI ( fd )
is passed in
.IR r0 ,
the caller must manually split and align the 64-bit value
so that it is passed in the
.IR r2 / r3
register pair.
That means inserting a dummy value into
.I r1
(the second argument of 0).

Similar issues can occur on MIPS with the O32 ABI,
on PowerPC with the 32-bit ABI, and on Xtensa.
.\" Mike Frysinger: this issue ends up forcing MIPS
.\" O32 to take 7 arguments to syscall()

The affected system calls are
.BR fadvise64_64 (2),
.BR ftruncate64 (2),
.BR posix_fadvise (2),
.BR pread64 (2),
.BR pwrite64 (2),
.BR readahead (2),
.BR sync_file_range (2),
and
.BR truncate64 (2).
.SS Architecture calling conventions
Every architecture has its own way of invoking and passing arguments to the
kernel.
The details for various architectures are listed in the two tables below.

The first table lists the instruction used to transition to kernel mode,
(which might not be the fastest or best way to transition to the kernel,
so you might have to refer to the VDSO),
the register used to indicate the system call number,
and the register used to return the system call result.
