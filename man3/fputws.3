.TH FPUTWS 3  1999-07-25 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
fputws \- write a wide-character string to a FILE stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "int fputws(const wchar_t *" ws ", FILE *" stream );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fputws ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of
the
.BR fputs (3)
function.
It writes the wide-character string starting at \fIws\fP, up to but
not including the terminating L\(aq\\0\(aq character, to \fIstream\fP.
.PP
For a non-locking counterpart, see
.BR unlocked_stdio (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR fputws ()
function returns a
nonnegative integer if the operation was
successful, or \-1 to indicate an error.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR fputws ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
.PP
In the absence of additional information passed to the
.BR fopen (3)
call, it is
reasonable to expect that
.BR fputws ()
will actually write the multibyte
string corresponding to the wide-character string \fIws\fP.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fputwc (3),
.BR unlocked_stdio (3)
