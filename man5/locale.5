.TH LOCALE 5 2014-03-03 "Linux" "Linux User Manual"
.SH NAME
locale \- describes a locale definition file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B locale
definition file contains all the information that the
.BR localedef (1)
command needs to convert it into the binary locale database.

The definition files consist of sections which each describe a
locale category in detail.
.SS Syntax
The locale definition file starts with a header that may consist
of the following keywords:
.TP
.I <escape_char>
is followed by a character that should be used as the
escape-character for the rest of the file to mark characters that
should be interpreted in a special way.
It defaults to the backslash (\\).
.TP
.I <comment_char>
is followed by a character that will be used as the
comment-character for the rest of the file.
It defaults to the number sign (#).
.PP
The locale definition has one part for each locale category.
Each part can be copied from another existing locale or
can be defined from scratch.
If the category should be copied,
the only valid keyword in the definition is
.B copy
followed by the name of the locale which should be copied.
.SS Locale category sections
The following category sections are defined by POSIX:
.IP * 3
