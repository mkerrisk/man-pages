.SH NAME
fork \- create a child process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.B pid_t fork(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fork
creates a child process that differs from the parent process only in its
PID and PPID, and in the fact that resource utilizations are set to 0.
File locks and pending signals are not inherited.
.PP
Under Linux,
.B fork
is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the only penalty incurred by
fork is the time and memory required to duplicate the parent's page tables,
and to create a unique task structure for the child.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent's thread
of execution, and a 0 is returned in the child's thread of execution.  On
failure, a \-1 will be returned in the parent's context, no child process
will be created, and
.I errno
will be set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EAGAIN
.B fork
cannot allocate sufficient memory to copy the parent's page tables and
allocate a task structure for the child.
.TP
.B EAGAIN
It was not possible to create a new process because the caller's
.B RLIMIT_NPROC
resource limit was encountered.
To exceed this limit, the process must have either the
.BR CAP_SYS_ADMIN
or the
.BR CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
capability.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
.B fork
failed to allocate the necessary kernel structures because memory is tight.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.B fork
call conforms to SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, BSD 4.3.
