.SH NAME
atanh, atanhf, atanhl \- inverse hyperbolic tangent function
.SH SYNOPSIS

.sp
.BI "float atanhf(float " x );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBatanh()\fP function calculates the inverse hyperbolic tangent of 
\fIx\fP; that is the value whose hyperbolic tangent is \fIx\fP.  If the
absolute value of \fIx\fP is greater than 1.0, \fBacosh()\fP returns 
not-a-number (NaN) and \fIerrno\fP is set.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EDOM
\fIx\fP is out of range.
