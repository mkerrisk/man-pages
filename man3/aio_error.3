.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <aio.h>"
.sp
.BI "int aio_error(const struct aiocb *" aiocbp );
.sp
Link with \fI\-lrt\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR aio_error ()
function returns the error status for the asynchronous I/O request
with control block pointed to by
.IR aiocbp .
(See
.BR aio (7)
for a description of the
.I aiocb
structure.)
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
This function returns one of the following:
.IP * 3
.BR EINPROGRESS ,
if the request has not been
completed yet.
.IP *
.BR ECANCELED ,
if the request was canceled.
.IP *
0, if the request completed successfully.
.IP *
A positive error, if the asynchronous I/O operation failed.
This is the same value that would have been stored in the

.BR read (2),
.BR write (2),
.BR fsync (2),
or
.BR fdatasync (2)
call.
