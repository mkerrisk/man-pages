.TH CHOWN 1 1998-11 "GNU fileutils 4.0"
.SH NAME
chown \- change file owner and group
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "chown [" options "] " user "[:" group "] " file...
.sp
POSIX options:
.B "[\-R] [\-\-]"
.sp
GNU options (shortest form):
.B "[\-cfhvR] [\-\-dereference]"
.BI [\-\-reference= rfile ]
.B "[\-\-help] [\-\-version] [\-\-]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chown
changes the user and/or group ownership of each given
.I file
as specified by the first non-option argument
as follows: if only a user name (or numeric user ID) is given,
that user is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group is
not changed.  If the user name is followed by a colon and a group
name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the group ownership
of the files is changed as well.
.SH "GNU DETAILS"
The GNU version allows a dot instead of a colon (following BSD).
[This was not allowed by POSIX since a dot is a valid character
in a user name.]
If a colon or dot but no group name follows
the user name, that user is made the owner of the files and the group of the
files is changed to that user's login group.  If the colon or dot and group
are given, but the user name is omitted, only the group of the files is
changed; in this case,
.B chown
performs the same function as
.BR chgrp .
