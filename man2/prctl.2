.TH PRCTL 2 2008-07-16 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
prctl \- operations on a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/prctl.h>
.sp
.BI "int prctl(int " option ", unsigned long " arg2 ", unsigned long " arg3 ,
.BI "          unsigned long " arg4 ", unsigned long " arg5 );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR prctl ()
is called with a first argument describing what to do
(with values defined in \fI<linux/prctl.h>\fP), and further
arguments with a significance depending on the first one.
The first argument can be:
.TP
.BR PR_CAPBSET_READ " (since Linux 2.6.25)
Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified in
.I arg2
is in the calling thread's capability bounding set,
or 0 if it is not.
(The capability constants are defined in
.IR <linux/capability.h> .)
The capability bounding set dictates
whether the process can receive the capability through a
file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to
.BR execve (2).

If the capability specified in
.I arg2
is not valid, then the call fails with the error
.BR EINVAL .
.TP
.BR PR_CAPBSET_DROP " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
If the calling thread has the
.B CAP_SETPCAP
capability, then drop the capability specified by
.I arg2
from the calling thread's capability bounding set.
Any children of the calling thread will inherit the newly
reduced bounding set.

The call fails with the error:
.B EPERM
if the calling thread does not have the
.BR CAP_SETPCAP ;
.BR EINVAL
if
.I arg2
does not represent a valid capability; or
.BR EINVAL
if file capabilities are not enabled in the kernel,
in which case bounding sets are not supported.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_DUMPABLE " (since Linux 2.3.20)"
Set the state of the flag determining whether core dumps are produced
for this process upon delivery of a signal whose default behavior is
to produce a core dump.
(Normally this flag is set for a process by default, but it is cleared
when a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is executed and also by
various system calls that manipulate process UIDs and GIDs).
In kernels up to and including 2.6.12,
.I arg2
must be either 0 (process is not dumpable) or 1 (process is dumpable).
Between kernels 2.6.13 and 2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted,
which caused any binary which normally would not be dumped
to be dumped readable by root only;
for security reasons, this feature has been removed.

.\" Subject:    Fix prctl privilege escalation (CVE-2006-2451)
.\" From:       Marcel Holtmann <marcel () holtmann ! org>
.\" Date:       2006-07-12 11:12:00
(See also the description of
.I /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
in
.BR proc (5).)
.TP
.BR PR_GET_DUMPABLE " (since Linux 2.3.20)"
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling
process's dumpable flag.
.\" Since Linux 2.6.13, the dumpable flag can have the value 2,
.\" but in 2.6.13 PR_GET_DUMPABLE simply returns 1 if the dumpable
.\" flags has a nonzero value.  This was fixed in 2.6.14.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_ENDIAN " (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)"
Set the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given
in \fIarg2\fP, which should be one of the following:
.\" Respectively 0, 1, 2
.BR PR_ENDIAN_BIG ,
.BR PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE ,
or
.B PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE
(PowerPC pseudo little endian).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_ENDIAN " (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)"
Return the endian-ness of the calling process,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_FPEMU " (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)"
Set floating-point emulation control bits to \fIarg2\fP.
Pass \fBPR_FPEMU_NOPRINT\fP to silently emulate fp operations accesses, or
\fBPR_FPEMU_SIGFPE\fP to not emulate fp operations and send
.B SIGFPE
instead.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_FPEMU " (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)"
Return floating-point emulation control bits,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_FPEXC " (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)"
Set floating-point exception mode to \fIarg2\fP.
Pass \fBPR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE\fP to use FPEXC for FP exception enables,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_DIV\fP for floating-point divide by zero,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_OVF\fP for floating-point overflow,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_UND\fP for floating-point underflow,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_RES\fP for floating-point inexact result,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_INV\fP for floating-point invalid operation,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_DISABLED\fP for FP exceptions disabled,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV\fP for async non-recoverable exception mode,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_ASYNC\fP for async recoverable exception mode,
\fBPR_FP_EXC_PRECISE\fP for precise exception mode.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_FPEXC " (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)"
Return floating-point exception mode,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_KEEPCAPS " (since Linux 2.2.18)"
Set the state of the thread's "keep capabilities" flag,
which determines whether the threads's effective and permitted
capability sets are cleared when a change is made to the threads's user IDs
such that the threads's real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID
all become nonzero when at least one of them previously had the value 0.
(By default, these credential sets are cleared).
.I arg2
must be either 0 (capabilities are cleared) or 1 (capabilities are kept).
This value will be reset to 0 on subsequent calls to
.BR execve (2).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_KEEPCAPS " (since Linux 2.2.18)"
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling threads's
"keep capabilities" flag.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_NAME " (since Linux 2.6.9)"
Set the process name for the calling process,
using the value in the location pointed to by
.IR "(char\ *) arg2" .
The name can be up to 16 bytes long,
.\" TASK_COMM_LEN in include/linux/sched.h
and should be null terminated if it contains fewer bytes.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_NAME " (since Linux 2.6.11)"
Return the process name for the calling process,
in the buffer pointed to by
.IR "(char\ *) arg2" .
The buffer should allow space for up to 16 bytes;
the returned string will be null terminated if it is shorter than that.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_PDEATHSIG " (since Linux 2.1.57)"
Set the parent process death signal
of the calling process to \fIarg2\fP (either a signal value
in the range 1..maxsig, or 0 to clear).
This is the signal that the calling process will get when its
parent dies.
This value is cleared for the child of a
.BR fork (2).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_PDEATHSIG " (since Linux 2.3.15)"
Return the current value of the parent process death signal,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.BR PR_SET_SECCOMP " (since Linux 2.6.23)"
.\" See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/542632
.\" [PATCH 0 of 2] seccomp updates
.\" andrea@cpushare.com
Set the secure computing mode for the calling thread.
In the current implementation,
.IR arg2
must be 1.
After the secure computing mode has been set to 1,
the only system calls that the thread is permitted to make are
.BR read (2),
.BR write (2),
.BR _exit (2),
and
.BR sigreturn (2).
Other system calls result in the delivery of a
.BR SIGKILL
signal.
Secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching applications
that may need to execute untrusted byte code,
perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.
This operation is only available
if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_SECCOMP " (since Linux 2.6.23)"
Return the secure computing mode of the calling thread.
Not very useful for the current implementation (mode equals 1),
but may be useful for other possible future modes:
if the caller is not in secure computing mode, this operation returns 0;
if the caller is in secure computing mode, then the
.BR prctl ()
call will cause a
.B SIGKILL
signal to be sent to the process.
This operation is only available
if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_SECUREBITS " (since Linux 2.6.26)"
Set the "securebits" flags of the calling thread to the value supplied in
.IR arg2 .
See
.BR capabilities (7).
.TP
.BR PR_GET_SECUREBITS " (since Linux 2.6.26)"
Return (as the function result)
the "securebits" flags of the calling thread.
See
.BR capabilities (7).
.TP
.BR PR_SET_TIMING " (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)"
Set whether to use (normal, traditional) statistical process timing or
accurate timestamp based process timing, by passing
.B PR_TIMING_STATISTICAL
.\" 0
or
.B PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP
.\" 1
to \fIarg2\fP.
.B PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP
is not currently implemented
(attempting to set this mode will yield the error
.BR EINVAL ).
.\" PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP doesn't do anything in 2.6.26-rc8,
.\" and looking at the patch history, it appears
.\" that it never did anything.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_TIMING " (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)"
Return (as the function result) which process timing method is currently
in use.
.TP
.BR PR_SET_TSC " (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)"
Set the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter
can be read by the process.
Pass
.B PR_TSC_ENABLE
to
.I arg2
to allow it to be read, or
.B PR_TSC_SIGSEGV
to generate a
.B SIGSEGV
when the process tries to read the timestamp counter.
.TP
.BR PR_GET_TSC " (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)"
Return the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter
can be read,
in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.TP
.B PR_SET_UNALIGN
(Only on: ia64, since Linux 2.3.48; parisc, since Linux 2.6.15;
PowerPC, since Linux 2.6.18; Alpha, since Linux 2.6.22)
Set unaligned access control bits to \fIarg2\fP.
Pass
\fBPR_UNALIGN_NOPRINT\fP to silently fix up unaligned user accesses,
or \fBPR_UNALIGN_SIGBUS\fP to generate
.B SIGBUS
on unaligned user access.
.TP
.B PR_GET_UNALIGN
(see
.B PR_SET_UNALIGN
for information on versions and architectures)
Return unaligned access control bits, in the location pointed to by
.IR "(int\ *) arg2" .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.BR PR_GET_DUMPABLE ,
.BR PR_GET_KEEPCAPS ,
.BR PR_CAPBSET_READ ,
.BR PR_GET_TIMING ,
.BR PR_GET_SECUREBITS ,
and (if it returns)
.BR PR_GET_SECCOMP
return the non-negative values described above.
All other
.I option
values return 0 on success.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.

.sp
.BI "ptrdiff_t prctl(int " option ", int " arg2 ", int " arg3 );
.sp
and options to get the maximum number of processes per user,
get the maximum number of processors the calling process can use,
find out whether a specified process is currently blocked,
