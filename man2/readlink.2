.TH READLINK 2 1997-08-21 "Linux 2.0.30" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
readlink \- read value of a symbolic link
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int readlink(const char *" path ", char *" buf ", size_t " bufsiz );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B readlink
places the contents of the symbolic link
.I path
in the buffer
.IR buf ,
which has size
.IR bufsiz .
.B readlink
does not append a
.B NUL
character to
.IR buf .
It will truncate the contents (to a length of
.I bufsiz
characters), in case the buffer is too small to hold all of the contents.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The call returns the count of characters placed in the buffer
if it succeeds, or a \-1 if an error occurs, placing the error
code in
.IR errno .
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
(See also
.BR path_resolution (2).)
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I buf
extends outside the process's allocated address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I bufsiz
is not positive.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The named file is not a symbolic link.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
