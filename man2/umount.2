.TH UMOUNT 2 2014-02-26 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
umount, umount2 \- unmount filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "#include <sys/mount.h>"
.sp
.BI "int umount(const char *" target );
.sp
.BI "int umount2(const char *" target ", int " flags );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR umount ()
and
.BR umount2 ()
remove the attachment of the (topmost) filesystem mounted on
.IR target .
.\" Note: the kernel naming differs from the glibc naming
.\" umount2 is the glibc name for what the kernel now calls umount
.\" and umount is the glibc name for oldumount

Appropriate privilege (Linux: the
.B CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability) is required to unmount filesystems.

Linux 2.1.116 added the
.BR umount2 ()
system call, which, like
.BR umount (),
unmounts a target, but allows additional
.I flags
controlling the behavior of the operation:
.TP
.BR MNT_FORCE " (since Linux 2.1.116)"
Force unmount even if busy.
This can cause data loss.
(Only for NFS mounts.)
.TP
.BR MNT_DETACH " (since Linux 2.4.11)"
Perform a lazy unmount: make the mount point unavailable for
new accesses, and actually perform the unmount when the mount point
ceases to be busy.
.TP
.BR MNT_EXPIRE " (since Linux 2.6.8)"
Mark the mount point as expired.
If a mount point is not currently in use, then an initial call to
.BR umount2 ()
with this flag fails with the error
.BR EAGAIN ,
but marks the mount point as expired.
The mount point remains expired as long as it isn't accessed
by any process.
A second
.BR umount2 ()
call specifying
.B MNT_EXPIRE
unmounts an expired mount point.
This flag cannot be specified with either
.B MNT_FORCE
or
.BR MNT_DETACH .
.TP
.BR UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW " (since Linux 2.6.34)"
.\" Later added to 2.6.33-stable
Don't dereference
.I target
if it is a symbolic link.
This flag allows security problems to be avoided in set-user-ID-\fIroot\fP
programs that allow unprivileged users to unmount filesystems.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
The error values given below result from filesystem type independent
errors.
Each filesystem type may have its own special errors and its
own special behavior.
See the Linux kernel source code for details.
.TP
.B EAGAIN
A call to
.BR umount2 ()
specifying
.B MNT_EXPIRE
successfully marked an unbusy filesystem as expired.
.TP
.B EBUSY
.I target
could not be unmounted because it is busy.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I target
points outside the user address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I target
is not a mount point.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.BR umount2 ()
was called with
.B MNT_EXPIRE
and either
.B MNT_DETACH
or
.BR MNT_FORCE .
.TP
.BR EINVAL " (since Linux 2.6.34)"
.BR umount2 ()
was called with an invalid flag value in
.IR flags .
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
A pathname was longer than
.BR MAXPATHLEN .
.TP
.B ENOENT
A pathname was empty or had a nonexistent component.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
The kernel could not allocate a free page to copy filenames or data into.
.TP
.B EPERM
The caller does not have the required privileges.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR MNT_DETACH
and
.BR MNT_EXPIRE
.\" http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10092
are available in glibc since version 2.11.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions are Linux-specific and should not be used in
programs intended to be portable.
.SH NOTES
The original
.BR umount ()
function was called as \fIumount(device)\fP and would return
.B ENOTBLK
when called with something other than a block device.
In Linux 0.98p4 a call \fIumount(dir)\fP was added, in order to
support anonymous devices.
In Linux 2.3.99-pre7 the call \fIumount(device)\fP was removed,
leaving only \fIumount(dir)\fP (since now devices can be mounted
in more than one place, so specifying the device does not suffice).
