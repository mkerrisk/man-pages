.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIval\fP utility shall determine whether the specified \fIfile\fP
is an SCCS file meeting the characteristics specified
by the options.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fIval\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines,
except that the usage of the \fB'-'\fP
operand is not strictly as intended by the guidelines (that is, reading
options and operands from standard input).
.LP
The following options shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fB-m\ \fP \fIname\fP
Specify a \fIname\fP, which is compared with the SCCS %\fBM\fP% keyword
in \fIfile\fP; see \fIget\fP
\&.
.TP 7
\fB-r\ \fP \fISID\fP
Specify a \fISID\fP (SCCS Identification String), an SCCS delta number.
A check shall be made to determine whether the
\fISID\fP is ambiguous (for example, \fB-r\ 1\fP is ambiguous because
it physically does not exist but implies 1.1, 1.2, and
so on, which may exist) or invalid (for example, \fB-r\ 1.0\fP or
\fB-r\ 1.1.0\fP are invalid because neither case can
exist as a valid delta number). If the \fISID\fP is valid and not
ambiguous, a check shall be made to determine whether it
actually exists.
.TP 7
\fB-s\fP
Silence the diagnostic message normally written to standard output
for any error that is detected while processing each named
file on a given command line.
.TP 7
\fB-y\ \fP \fItype\fP
Specify a \fItype\fP, which shall be compared with the SCCS %\fBY\fP%
keyword in \fIfile\fP; see \fIget\fP .
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fIfile\fP
A pathname of an existing SCCS file. If exactly one \fIfile\fP operand
appears, and it is \fB'-'\fP , the standard input
shall be read: each line shall be independently processed as if it
were a command line argument list. (However, the line is not
subjected to any of the shell word expansions, such as parameter expansion
or quote removal.)
.sp
.SH STDIN
.LP
The standard input shall be a text file used only when the \fIfile\fP
operand is specified as \fB'-'\fP .
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
Any SCCS files processed shall be files of an unspecified format.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIval\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error,
and informative messages written to standard output.
.TP 7
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
The standard output shall consist of informative messages about either:
.IP " 1." 4
Each file processed
.LP
.IP " 2." 4
Each command line read from standard input
.LP
.LP
If the standard input is not used, for each \fIfile\fP operand yielding
a discrepancy, the output line shall have the following
format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"%s: %s\\n", <\fP\fIpathname\fP\fB>, <\fP\fIunspecified string\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
If standard input is used, a line of input shall be written before
each of the preceding lines for files containing
discrepancies:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"%s:\\n", <\fP\fIinput line\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH STDERR
.LP
Not used.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
None.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The 8-bit code returned by \fIval\fP shall be a disjunction of the
possible errors; that is, it can be interpreted as a bit
string where set bits are interpreted as follows:
.TS C
center; l l l.
0x80	=	Missing file argument.
0x40	=	Unknown or duplicate option.
0x20	=	Corrupted SCCS file.
0x10	=	Cannot open file or file not SCCS.
0x08	=	\fISID\fP is invalid or ambiguous.
0x04	=	\fISID\fP does not exist.
0x02	=	%\fBY\fP%, \fB-y\fP mismatch.
0x01	=	%\fBM\fP%, \fB-m\fP mismatch.
.TE
.LP
Note that \fIval\fP can process two or more files on a given command
line and can process multiple command lines (when reading
the standard input). In these cases an aggregate code shall be returned:
a logical OR of the codes generated for each command line
and file processed.
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
Default.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Since the \fIval\fP exit status sets the 0x80 bit, shell applications
checking \fB"$?"\fP cannot tell if it terminated due
to a missing file argument or receipt of a signal.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
In a directory with three SCCS files- \fBs.x\fP (of \fBt\fP type "text"),
\fBs.y\fP, and \fBs.z\fP (a corrupted file)-the
following command could produce the output shown:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBval - <<EOF
-y source s.x
-m y s.y
s.z
EOF
.sp

-y source s.x
.sp

    s.x: %Y%, -y mismatch
s.z
.sp

    s.z: corrupted SCCS file
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
