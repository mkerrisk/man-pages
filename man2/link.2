.TH LINK 2 2004-06-23 "Linux 2.6.7" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
link \- make a new name for a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int link(const char *" oldpath ", const char *" newpath );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B link
creates a new link (also known as a hard link) to an existing file.

If
.I newpath
exists it will
.I not
be overwritten.

This new name may be used exactly as the old one for any operation;
both names refer to the same file (and so have the same permissions
and ownership) and it is impossible to tell which name was the
`original'.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
Write access to the directory containing
.I newpath
is denied, or search permission is denied for one of the directories
in the path prefix of
.I oldpath
or
.IR newpath .
(See also
.BR path_resolution (2).)
.TP
.B EEXIST
.I newpath
already exists.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.IR oldpath " or " newpath " points outside your accessible address space."
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
.IR oldpath " or " newpath .
.TP
.B EMLINK
The file referred to by
.I oldpath
already has the maximum number of links to it.
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.IR oldpath " or " newpath " was too long."
.TP
.B ENOENT
A directory component in
.IR oldpath " or " newpath
does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOSPC
The device containing the file has no room for the new directory
entry.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component used as a directory in
.IR oldpath " or " newpath
is not, in fact, a directory.
.TP
.B EPERM
.I oldpath
is a directory.
.TP
.B EPERM
The filesystem containing
.IR oldpath " and " newpath
does not support the creation of hard links.
.TP
.B EROFS
The file is on a read-only filesystem.
.TP
.B EXDEV
.IR oldpath " and " newpath
are not on the same filesystem.
.SH NOTES
Hard links, as created by
.BR link ,
cannot span filesystems. Use
.B symlink
if this is required.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID, POSIX, BSD 4.3, X/OPEN.  SVr4 documents additional ENOLINK and
EMULTIHOP error conditions; POSIX.1 does not document ELOOP.
X/OPEN does not document EFAULT, ENOMEM or EIO.
.SH BUGS
On NFS file systems, the return code may be wrong in case the NFS server
performs the link creation and dies before it can say so.  Use
.BR stat (2)
to find out if the link got created.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.BR open (2),
.BR path_resolution (2),
.BR rename (2),
