.SH NAME
clearerr, feof, ferror \- check and reset stream status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>
.PP
.BI "void clearerr(FILE *" stream );
.BI "int feof(FILE *" stream );
.BI "int ferror(FILE *" stream );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR clearerr ()
clears the end-of-file and error indicators for the stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
.PP
The function
.BR feof ()
tests the end-of-file indicator for the stream pointed to by
.IR stream ,
returning nonzero if it is set.
The end-of-file indicator can be cleared only by the function
.BR clearerr ().
.PP
The function
.BR ferror ()
tests the error indicator for the stream pointed to by
.IR stream ,
returning nonzero if it is set.
The error indicator can be reset only by the
.BR clearerr ()
function.
.PP
For nonlocking counterparts, see
.BR unlocked_stdio (3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR feof ()
function returns nonzero if the end-of-file indicator is set for
.IR stream ;
otherwise, it returns zero.
.PP
The
.BR ferror ()
function returns nonzero if the error indicator is set for
.IR stream ;
otherwise, it returns zero.
.SH ERRORS
These functions should not fail and do not set
.IR errno .
