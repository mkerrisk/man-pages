.TH PTHREAD_KILL 3 2014-02-04 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
pthread_kill \- send a signal to a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <pthread.h>

.BI "int pthread_kill(pthread_t " thread ", int " sig );
.fi
.sp
Compile and link with \fI\-pthread\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_kill ()
function sends the signal
.I sig
to
.IR thread ,
a thread in the same process as the caller.
The signal is asynchronously directed to
.IR thread .

If
.I sig
is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still performed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR pthread_kill ()
returns 0;
on error, it returns an error number, and no signal is sent.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
An invalid signal was specified.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2008.
.SH NOTES
Signal dispositions are process-wide:
if a signal handler is installed,
the handler will be invoked in the thread
.IR thread ,
but if the disposition of the signal is "stop", "continue", or "terminate",
this action will affect the whole process.

POSIX.1-2008 recommends that if an implementation detects the use
of a thread ID after the end of its lifetime,
.BR pthread_kill ()
should return the error
.BR ESRCH .
The glibc implementation returns this error in the cases where
an invalid thread ID can be detected.
But note also that POSIX says that an attempt to use a thread ID whose
lifetime has ended produces undefined behavior,
and an attempt to use an invalid thread ID in a call to
.BR pthread_kill ()
can, for example, cause a segmentation fault.
