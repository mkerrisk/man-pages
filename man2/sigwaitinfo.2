.TH SIGWAITINFO 2 2002-06-07 "Linux 2.4.18" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigwaitinfo, sigtimedwait \- synchronously wait for queued signals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int sigwaitinfo(const sigset_t *" set ", siginfo_t *" info ");"
.sp
.BI "int sigtimedwait(const sigset_t *" set ", siginfo_t *" info ", "
.BI "const struct timespec " timeout ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
suspends execution of the calling process until one of the signals in
.I set
is delivered.
(If one of the signals in
.I set
is already pending for the calling process,
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
will return immediately with information about that signal.)

.BR sigwaitinfo ()
removes the delivered signal from the calling process's list of pending
signals and returns the signal number as its function result.
If the
.I info
argument is not
.BR NULL ,
then it returns a structure of type
.I siginfo_t
(see
.BR sigaction (2))
containing information about the signal.
.PP
Signals returned via
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
are delivered in the usual order; see
.BR signal (7)
for further details.
.PP
.BR sigtimedwait ()
operates in exactly the same way as
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
except that it has an additional argument,
.IR timeout ,
which enables an upper bound to be placed on the time for which
the process is suspended.
This argument is of the following type:
.sp
.in +2n
.nf
struct timespec {
    long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
}
.fi
.in -2n
.sp
If both fields of this structure are specified as 0, a poll is performed:
.BR sigtimedwait ()
returns immediately, either with information about a signal that
was pending for the caller, or with an error
if none of the signals in
.I set
was pending.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, both
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
and
.BR sigtimedwait ()
return a signal number (i.e., a value greater than zero).
On failure both calls return \-1, with
.I errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EAGAIN
No signal in
.I set
was delivered within the
.I timeout
period specified to
.BR sigtimedwait ().
.TP
.B EINTR
The wait was interrupted by a signal handler.
(This handler was for a signal other than one of those in
.IR set .)
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I timeout
was invalid.
.SH NOTES
In normal usage, the caller blocks the signals in
.I set
via a prior call to
.BR sigprocmask ()
(so that the default disposition for these signals does not occur if they
are delivered between successive calls to
.BR sigwaitinfo () or
.BR sigtimedwait())
and does not establish handlers for these signals.
.PP
POSIX leaves the meaning of a
.B NULL
value for the
.I timeout
argument of
.BR sigtimedwait ()
unspecified, permitting the possibility that this has the same meaning
as a call to
.BR sigwaitinfo (),
and indeed this is what is done on Linux.
