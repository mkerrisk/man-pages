.TH READDIR 3  1996-04-22 "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
readdir \- read a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.sp
.B #include <dirent.h>
.sp
.BI "struct dirent *readdir(DIR *" dir );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBreaddir\fP() function returns a pointer to a \fIdirent\fP structure
representing the next directory entry in the directory stream pointed
to by \fIdir\fP.  It returns NULL on reaching the end-of-file or if
an error occurred.
.PP
On Linux, the
.I dirent
structure is defined as follows:
.PP
.RS 0.25i
.nf
struct dirent {
    ino_t          d_ino;       /* inode number */
    off_t          d_off;       /* offset to the next dirent */
    unsigned short d_reclen;    /* length of this record */
    unsigned char  d_type;      /* type of file */
    char           d_name[256]; /* filename */
};
.fi
.RE
.PP
According to POSIX, the
.I dirent
structure contains a field
.I "char d_name[]"
of unspecified size, with at most
.B NAME_MAX
characters preceding the terminating null byte.
POSIX.1-2001 also documents the field
.I "ino_t d_ino"
as an XSI extension.
.IR "Use of other fields will harm the portability of your programs" .
.PP
The data returned by \fBreaddir\fP() may be overwritten by subsequent
calls to \fBreaddir\fP() for the same directory stream.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBreaddir\fP() function returns a pointer to a 
.I dirent 
structure, or
NULL if an error occurs or end-of-file is reached.
On error,
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
Invalid directory stream descriptor \fIdir\fP.
