.TH SENDMMSG 2 2011-09-09 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sendmmsg \- send multiple messages on a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "#define _GNU_SOURCE"
.BI "#include <sys/socket.h>"

.BI "int sendmmsg(int " sockfd ", struct mmsghdr *" msgvec \
", unsigned int " vlen ","
.BI "             unsigned int " flags ");" 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.BR sendmmsg ()
system call is an extension of
.BR sendmsg (2)
that allows the caller to transmit multiple messages on a socket
using a single system call.
(This has performance benefits for some applications.)
.\" See commit 228e548e602061b08ee8e8966f567c12aa079682

The
.I sockfd 
argument is the file descriptor of the socket
on which data is to be transmitted.

The
.I msgvec
argument is a pointer to an array of
.I mmsghdr
structures.
The size of this array is specified in
.IR vlen .

The
.I mmsghdr
structure is defined in
.I <sys/socket.h>
as:

.in +4n
.nf
struct mmsghdr {
    struct msghdr msg_hdr;  /* Message header */
    unsigned int  msg_len;  /* Number of bytes transmitted */
};
.fi
.in
.PP
The
.I msg_hdr 
field is a
.I msghdr
structure, as described in
.BR sendmsg (2).
The
.I msg_len
field is used to return the number of bytes sent from the message in
.IR msg_hdr
(i.e., the same as the return value from a single
.BR sendmsg (2)
call).

The
.I flags
argument contains flags ORed together.
The flags are the same as for
.BR sendmsg (2).

A blocking
.BR sendmmsg ()
call blocks until
.I vlen
messages have been sent.
A nonblocking call sends as many messages as possible
(up to the limit specified by
.IR vlen )
and returns immediately.

On return from
.BR sendmmsg (),
the
.I msg_len
fields of successive elements of
.IR msgvec
are updated to contain the number of bytes transmitted from the corresponding
.IR msg_hdr .
The return value of the call indicates the number of elements of
.I msgvec
that have been updated.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR sendmmsg ()
returns the number of messages sent from
.IR msgvec ;
if this is less than
.IR vlen ,
the caller can retry with a further
.BR sendmmsg ()
call to send the remaining messages.

On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
Errors are as for
.BR sendmsg (2).
An error is returned only if no datagrams could be sent.
.\" commit 728ffb86f10873aaf4abd26dde691ee40ae731fe
.\"     ... only return an error if no datagrams could be sent.
.\"     If less than the requested number of messages were sent, the application
.\"     must retry starting at the first failed one and if the problem is
.\"     persistent the error will be returned.
.\"     
.\"     This matches the behaviour of other syscalls like read/write - it
.\"     is not an error if less than the requested number of elements are sent.
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR sendmmsg ()
system call was added in Linux 3.0.
Support in glibc was added in version 2.14.
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR sendmmsg ()
is Linux-specific.
.SH NOTES
The value specified in
.I vlen
is capped to
.B UIO_MAXIOV
(1024).
.\" commit 98382f419f32d2c12d021943b87dea555677144b
.\"     net: Cap number of elements for sendmmsg
.\"    
.\"     To limit the amount of time we can spend in sendmmsg, cap the
.\"     number of elements to UIO_MAXIOV (currently 1024).
.\"
.\"     For error handling an application using sendmmsg needs to retry at
.\"     the first unsent message, so capping is simpler and requires less
.\"     application logic than returning EINVAL.
