Installing and uninstalling
===========================
"make install" will copy these man pages to /usr/local/share/man/man[1-8].

To install to a path different from /usr/local, use
"make install prefix=/install/path".

"make remove" or "make uninstall" will remove any man page in this
distribution from its destination.  Use with caution, and remember to
use "prefix" if desired, as with the "install" target.

To install only a specific man section (mandir) such as man3, use
"make install-man3".  Similar syntax can be used to uninstall a
specific man section, such as man7: "make uninstall-man7".

"make" or "make all" will perform "make uninstall" followed by "make
install".

Consider using multiple threads (at least 2) when installing
these man pages, as the Makefile is optimized for multiple threads:
"make -j install".
