.SH NAME
console_codes \- Linux console escape and control sequences
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Linux console implements a large subset of the VT102 and ECMA-48/ISO
6429/ANSI X3.64 terminal controls, plus certain private-mode sequences
for changing the color palette, character-set mapping, etc.
In the tabular descriptions below, the second column gives ECMA-48 or DEC
mnemonics (the latter if prefixed with DEC) for the given function.
Sequences without a mnemonic are neither ECMA-48 nor VT102.
.LP
After all the normal output processing has been done, and a
stream of characters arrives at the console driver for actual
printing, the first thing that happens is a translation from
the code used for processing to the code used for printing.
.LP
If the console is in UTF-8 mode, then the incoming bytes are
first assembled into 16-bit Unicode codes.  Otherwise
each byte is transformed according to the current mapping table
(which translates it to a Unicode value).  See the CHARACTER SETS
section below for discussion.
.LP
In the normal case, the Unicode value is converted to a font index,
and this is stored in video memory, so that the corresponding glyph
(as found in video ROM) appears on the screen.
Note that the use of Unicode (and the design of the PC hardware)
allows us to use 512 different glyphs simultaneously.
.LP
If the current Unicode value is a control character, or we are
currently processing an escape sequence, the value will treated
specially.  Instead of being turned into a font index and rendered as
a glyph, it may trigger cursor movement or other control functions.
See the LINUX CONSOLE CONTROLS section below for discussion.
.LP
It is generally not good practice to hard-wire terminal controls into
programs.  Linux supports a 
.BR terminfo (5)
database of terminal capabilities.  
Rather than emitting console escape sequences by hand, you will almost
always want to use a terminfo-aware screen library or utility such as
.BR ncurses (3),
.BR tput (1), 
or
.BR reset (1).

.SH "LINUX CONSOLE CONTROLS"

This section describes all the control characters and escape sequences
that invoke special functions (i.e. anything other than writing a
glyph at the current cursor location) on the Linux console. 
.SS "Control characters"
A character is a control character if (before transformation
according to the mapping table) it has one of the 14 codes
00 (NUL), 07 (BEL), 08 (BS), 09 (HT), 0a (LF), 0b (VT),
0c (FF), 0d (CR), 0e (SO), 0f (SI), 18 (CAN), 1a (SUB),
1b (ESC), 7f (DEL).
One can set a `display control characters' mode (see below),
and allow 07, 09, 0b, 18, 1a, 7f to be displayed as glyphs.
On the other hand, in UTF-8 mode all codes 00-1f are regarded
as control characters, regardless of any `display control characters'
mode.

If we have a control character, it is acted upon immediately
and then discarded (even in the middle of an escape sequence)
and the escape sequence continues with the next character.
(However, ESC starts a new escape sequence, possibly aborting a previous
unfinished one, and CAN and SUB abort any escape sequence.)
The recognized control characters are BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF,
CR, SO, SI, CAN, SUB, ESC, DEL, CSI. They do what one would expect:
.HP
BEL (0x07, ^G) beeps;
.HP
BS (0x08, ^H) backspaces one column
(but not past the beginning of the line);
.HP
HT (0x09, ^I) goes to the next tab stop or to the end of the line
if there is no earlier tab stop;
.HP
LF (0x0A, ^J), VT (0x0B, ^K) and FF (0x0C, ^L) all give a linefeed;
.HP
CR (0x0D, ^M) gives a carriage return;
.HP
SO (0x0E, ^N) activates the G1 character set,
and if LF/NL (new line mode) is set also a carriage return;
.HP
SI (0x0F, ^O) activates the G0 character set;
.HP
CAN (0x18, ^X) and SUB (0x1A, ^Z) interrupt escape sequences;
.HP
ESC (0x1B, ^[) starts an escape sequence;
.HP
DEL (0x7F) is ignored;
.HP
CSI (0x9B) is equivalent to ESC [.

.SS "ECMA-48 CSI sequences"

CSI (or ESC [) is followed by a sequence of parameters,
at most NPAR (16), that are decimal numbers separated by
semicolons. An empty or absent parameter is taken to be 0.
The sequence of parameters may be preceded by a single question mark.

However, after CSI [ (or ESC [ [) a single character is read
and this entire sequence is ignored. (The idea is to ignore
an echoed function key.)

The action of a CSI sequence is determined by its final character.

.SH "CHARACTER SETS"

The kernel knows about 4 translations of bytes into console-screen symbols.
The four tables are: a) Latin1 -> PC,  b) VT100 graphics -> PC, c) PC -> PC,
d) user-defined.

There are two character sets, called G0 and G1, and one of them
is the current character set. (Initially G0.)
Typing ^N causes G1 to become current, ^O causes G0 to become current.

These variables G0 and G1 point at a translation table, and can be changed
by the user. Initially they point at tables a) and b), respectively.
The sequences ESC ( B and ESC ( 0 and ESC ( U and ESC ( K cause G0 to point
at translation table a), b), c) and d), respectively.
The sequences ESC ) B and ESC ) 0 and ESC ) U and ESC ) K cause G1 to point
at translation table a), b), c) and d), respectively.

The sequence ESC c causes a terminal reset, which is what you want if the
screen is all garbled. The oft-advised "echo ^V^O" will only make G0 current,
but there is no guarantee that G0 points at table a).
In some distributions there is a program
.BR reset (1)
that just does "echo ^[c".
If your terminfo entry for the console is correct (and has an entry rs1=\\Ec),
then "tput reset" will also work.

The user-defined mapping table can be set using
.BR mapscrn (8).
The result of the mapping is that if a symbol c is printed, the symbol
s = map[c] is sent to the video memory. The bitmap that corresponds to
s is found in the character ROM, and can be changed using
.BR setfont(8).

.SH "MOUSE TRACKING"

The mouse tracking facility is intended to return xterm-compatible
mouse status reports.  Because the console driver has no way to know
the device or type of the mouse, these reports are returned in the 
console input stream only when the virtual terminal driver receives 
a mouse update ioctl.  These ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware
user-mode application such as the \fBgpm(8)\fR daemon.

Parameters for all mouse tracking escape sequences generated by
\fIxterm\fP encode numeric parameters in a single character as
\fIvalue\fP+040.  For example, `!' is 1.  The screen
coordinate system is 1-based.

The X10 compatibility mode sends an escape sequence on button press
encoding the location and the mouse button pressed.
It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 9 h and disabled with ESC [ ? 9 l.
On button press, \fIxterm\fP sends
ESC [ M \fIbxy\fP (6 characters).  Here \fIb\fP is button\-1,
and \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are the x and y coordinates of the mouse
when the button was pressed.
This is the same code the kernel also produces.

Normal tracking mode (not implemented in Linux 2.0.24) sends an escape
sequence on both button press and release.  Modifier information is
also sent.  It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 1000 h and disabled with
ESC [ 1000 l.  On button press or release, \fIxterm\fP sends ESC [ M
\fIbxy\fP.  The low two bits of \fIb\fP encode button information:
0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release.  The upper
bits encode what modifiers were down when the button was pressed and
are added together: 4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control.  Again \fIx\fP and
\fIy\fP are the x and y coordinates of the mouse event.  The upper
left corner is (1,1).

.SH "COMPARISONS WITH OTHER TERMINALS"

Many different terminal types are described, like the Linux console,
as being `VT100-compatible'.  Here we discuss differences vbetween the
Linux console an the two most important others, the DEC VT102 and
.BR xterm (1).
.\"
.SS Control-character handling
The vt102 also recognized the following control characters:
.HP
NUL (0x00) was ignored;
.HP
ENQ (0x05) triggered an answerback message;
.HP
DC1 (0x11, ^Q, XON) resumed transmission;
.HP
DC3 (0x13, ^S, XOFF) caused vt100 to ignore (and stop transmitting)
all codes except XOFF and XON.
.LP
VT100-like DC1/DC3 processing may be enabled by the tty driver.
.LP
The 
.I xterm
program (in vt100 mode) recognizes the control characters 
BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF, CR, SO, SI, ESC.
