.TH NAMESPACES 7 2021-03-22 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
namespaces \- overview of Linux namespaces
.SH DESCRIPTION
A namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that
makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they
have their own isolated instance of the global resource.
Changes to the global resource are visible to other processes
that are members of the namespace, but are invisible to other processes.
One use of namespaces is to implement containers.
.PP
This page provides pointers to information on the various namespace types,
describes the associated
.I /proc
files, and summarizes the APIs for working with namespaces.
.\"
.SS Namespace types
The following table shows the namespace types available on Linux.
The second column of the table shows the flag value that is used to specify
the namespace type in various APIs.
The third column identifies the manual page that provides details
on the namespace type.
The last column is a summary of the resources that are isolated by
the namespace type.

.\" ==================== The namespaces API ====================
.\"
.SS The namespaces API
As well as various
.I /proc
files described below,
the namespaces API includes the following system calls:
.TP
.BR clone (2)
The
.BR clone (2)
system call creates a new process.
If the
.I flags
argument of the call specifies one or more of the
.B CLONE_NEW*
flags listed below, then new namespaces are created for each flag,
and the child process is made a member of those namespaces.
(This system call also implements a number of features
unrelated to namespaces.)
.TP
.BR setns (2)
The
.BR setns (2)
system call allows the calling process to join an existing namespace.
The namespace to join is specified via a file descriptor that refers to
one of the
.IR /proc/[pid]/ns
files described below.
.TP
.BR unshare (2)
The
.BR unshare (2)
system call moves the calling process to a new namespace.
If the
.I flags
argument of the call specifies one or more of the
.B CLONE_NEW*
flags listed below, then new namespaces are created for each flag,
and the calling process is made a member of those namespaces.
(This system call also implements a number of features
unrelated to namespaces.)
.TP
.BR ioctl (2)
Various
.BR ioctl (2)
operations can be used to discover information about namespaces.
These operations are described in
.BR ioctl_ns (2).
.PP
Creation of new namespaces using
.BR clone (2)
and
.BR unshare (2)
in most cases requires the
.BR CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability, since, in the new namespace,
the creator will have the power to change global resources
that are visible to other processes that are subsequently created in,
or join the namespace.
User namespaces are the exception: since Linux 3.8,
no privilege is required to create a user namespace.

Bind mounting (see
.BR mount (2))
one of the files in this directory
to somewhere else in the filesystem keeps
the corresponding namespace of the process specified by
.I pid
alive even if all processes currently in the namespace terminate.
.PP
Opening one of the files in this directory
(or a file that is bind mounted to one of these files)
returns a file handle for
the corresponding namespace of the process specified by
.IR pid .
As long as this file descriptor remains open,
the namespace will remain alive,
even if all processes in the namespace terminate.
The file descriptor can be passed to
.BR setns (2).
.PP
In Linux 3.7 and earlier, these files were visible as hard links.
Since Linux 3.8,
.\" commit bf056bfa80596a5d14b26b17276a56a0dcb080e5
they appear as symbolic links.
If two processes are in the same namespace,
then the device IDs and inode numbers of their
.IR /proc/[pid]/ns/xxx
symbolic links will be the same; an application can check this using the
.I stat.st_dev

of the symbolic link will return an empty buffer.)

.\" ==================== The /proc/sys/user directory ====================
.\"
.SS The /proc/sys/user directory
The files in the
.I /proc/sys/user
directory (which is present since Linux 4.9) expose limits
on the number of namespaces of various types that can be created.
The files are as follows:
.TP
.IR max_cgroup_namespaces
The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
cgroup namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.
.TP
.IR max_ipc_namespaces
The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
ipc namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.
.TP
.IR max_mnt_namespaces
The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
mount namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.
.TP
.IR max_net_namespaces
The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
network namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.
.TP
.IR max_pid_namespaces
The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
PID namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.
.TP
.IR max_time_namespaces " (since Linux 5.7)"
.\" commit eeec26d5da8248ea4e240b8795bb4364213d3247
The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
time namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.
.TP
.IR max_user_namespaces
The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
user namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.
.TP
.IR max_uts_namespaces
The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
uts namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.
.PP
Note the following details about these files:
.IP * 3
The values in these files are modifiable by privileged processes.
.IP *
The values exposed by these files are the limits for the user namespace
in which the opening process resides.
.IP *
The limits are per-user.
Each user in the same user namespace
can create namespaces up to the defined limit.
.IP *
The limits apply to all users, including UID 0.
.IP *
These limits apply in addition to any other per-namespace
limits (such as those for PID and user namespaces) that may be enforced.
.IP *
Upon encountering these limits,
.BR clone (2)
and
.BR unshare (2)
fail with the error
.BR ENOSPC .
.IP *
For the initial user namespace,
the default value in each of these files is half the limit on the number
of threads that may be created
.RI ( /proc/sys/kernel/threads\-max ).
In all descendant user namespaces, the default value in each file is
.BR MAXINT .
.IP *
When a namespace is created, the object is also accounted
against ancestor namespaces.
More precisely:
.RS
.IP + 3
Each user namespace has a creator UID.
.IP +
When a namespace is created,
it is accounted against the creator UIDs in each of the
ancestor user namespaces,
and the kernel ensures that the corresponding namespace limit
for the creator UID in the ancestor namespace is not exceeded.
.IP +
The aforementioned point ensures that creating a new user namespace
cannot be used as a means to escape the limits in force
in the current user namespace.

.\"
.SS Namespace lifetime
Absent any other factors,
a namespace is automatically torn down when the last process in
the namespace terminates or leaves the namespace.
However, there are a number of other factors that may pin
a namespace into existence even though it has no member processes.
These factors include the following:
.IP * 3
An open file descriptor or a bind mount exists for the corresponding
.IR /proc/[pid]/ns/*
file.
.IP *
The namespace is hierarchical (i.e., a PID or user namespace),
and has a child namespace.
.IP *
It is a user namespace that owns one or more nonuser namespaces.
.IP *
It is a PID namespace,
and there is a process that refers to the namespace via a
.IR /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children
symbolic link.
.IP *
It is a time namespace,
and there is a process that refers to the namespace via a
.IR /proc/[pid]/ns/time_for_children
symbolic link.
.IP *
It is an IPC namespace, and a corresponding mount of an
.I mqueue
filesystem (see
.BR mq_overview (7))
refers to this namespace.
.IP *
It is a PID namespace, and a corresponding mount of a
.BR proc (5)
filesystem refers to this namespace.
