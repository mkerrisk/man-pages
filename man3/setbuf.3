.SH DESCRIPTION
The three types of buffering available are unbuffered, block buffered, and
line buffered.  When an output stream is unbuffered, information appears on
the destination file or terminal as soon as written; when it is block
buffered many characters are saved up and written as a block; when it is
line buffered characters are saved up until a newline is output or input is
read from any stream attached to a terminal device (typically stdin).  The
function
.BR fflush (3)
may be used to force the block out early.
(See 
.BR fclose (3).)
Normally all files are block buffered.  When the first I/O operation occurs
on a file,
.BR malloc (3)
is called, and a buffer is obtained.  If a stream refers to a terminal (as
.I stdout
normally does) it is line buffered.  The standard error stream
.I stderr
is always unbuffered by default.
.PP
The
.B setvbuf
function may be used on any open stream to change its buffer.
The
.I mode
parameter must be one of the following three macros:
.RS
.TP
.B _IONBF
unbuffered
.TP
.B _IOLBF
line buffered
.TP
.B _IOFBF
fully buffered
.RE
.PP
Except for unbuffered files, the
.I buf
argument should point to a buffer at least
.I size
bytes long; this buffer will be used instead of the current buffer.  If the
argument
.I buf
is
.BR NULL ,
only the mode is affected; a new buffer will be allocated on the next read
or write operation.  The
.B setvbuf
function may only be used after opening a stream and before any other
operations have been performed on it.
.PP
The other three calls are, in effect, simply aliases for calls to
.BR setvbuf .
The
.B setbuf
function is exactly equivalent to the call
.PP
.RS
setvbuf(stream, buf, buf ? _IOFBF : _IONBF, BUFSIZ);
.RE
.PP
The
.B setbuffer
function is the same, except that the size of the buffer is up to the
caller, rather than being determined by the default
.BR BUFSIZ .
The
.B setlinebuf
function is exactly equivalent to the call:
.PP
.RS
setvbuf(stream, (char *)NULL, _IOLBF, 0);
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The function
.B setvbuf
returns 0 on success.
It can return any value on failure, but returns nonzero when
.I mode
is invalid or the request cannot be honoured. It may set
.I errno
on failure.
The other functions are void.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.B setbuf
and
.B setvbuf
functions conform to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
.SH BUGS
The
.B setbuffer
and
.B setlinebuf
functions are not portable to versions of BSD before 4.2BSD, and
are available under Linux since libc 4.5.21.  On 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD systems,
.B setbuf
always uses a suboptimal buffer size and should be avoided.
.P
You must make sure that both
.I buf
and the space it points to still exist by the time 
.I stream
is closed, which also happens at program termination.
.P
For example, the following is illegal:
.nf
.sp
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char buf[BUFSIZ];
    setbuf(stdin, buf);
    printf("Hello, world!\\n");
    return 0;
}
.fi
