.TH RESTART_SYSCALL 2 2013-07-30 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
restart_syscall \- restart a system call after interruption by a stop signal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int restart_syscall(void);

.IR Note :
There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR restart_syscall ()
system call is used to restart certain system calls
after a process that was stopped by a signal (e.g.,
.BR SIGSTOP
or
.BR SIGTSTP )
is later resumed after receiving a
.BR SIGCONT
signal.
This system call is designed only for internal use by the kernel.

.BR restart_syscall ()
is used for restarting only those system calls that,
when restarted, should adjust their time-related parameters\(emnamely
.BR poll (2)
(since Linux 2.6.24),
.BR nanosleep (2)
(since Linux 2.6),
.BR clock_nanosleep (2)
(since Linux 2.6),
and
.BR futex (2),
when employed with the
.BR FUTEX_WAIT
(since Linux 2.6.22)
and
.BR FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET
(since Linux 2.6.31)
operations.
.\" These system calls correspond to the special internal errno value
.\" ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK. Each of the system calls has a "restart"
.\" helper function that is invoked by restart_syscall().
.BR restart_syscall ()
restarts the interrupted system call with a
time argument that is suitably adjusted to account for the
time that has already elapsed (including the time where the process
was stopped by a signal).
Without the
.BR restart_syscall ()
mechanism, restarting these system calls would not correctly deduce the
already elapsed time when the process continued execution.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value of
.BR restart_syscall ()
is the return value of whatever system call is being restarted.
.SH ERRORS
.I errno
is set as per the errors for whatever system call is being restarted by
.BR restart_syscall ().
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR restart_syscall ()
system call is present since Linux 2.6.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This system call is Linux-specific.
.SH NOTES
There is no glibc wrapper for this system call,
because it is intended for use only by the kernel and
should never be called by applications.

From user space, the operation of
.BR restart_syscall (2)
is largely invisible:
to the process that made the system call that is restarted,
it appears as though that system call executed and
returned in the usual fashion.
.\"
.\" FIXME
.\" There is one oddness in the implementation though, with respect to
.\" nanosleep() (and probably also clock_nanosleep()). The scenario
.\" is as follows:
.\"    1. Start a nanosleep() for (say) 30 seconds,
.\"    2. Stop the process with (say) SIGTSTP (^Z).
.\"    3. Resume the process with SIGCONT,
.\"    4. Upon return, the 'rem' argument of nanosleep() will contain the
.\"       remaining unslept time **at the time when SIGTSTP was delivered**.
.\" The behavior at point 4 is odd, but doesn't violate the standards, which
.\" specify the treatment of 'rem' only when the system call returns with
.\" the error EINTR (i.e., the call was interrupted by a signal handler).
.\"
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR sigaction (2),
.BR sigreturn (2),
.BR signal (7)
.\" FIXME select(2) should probably get the restart_syscall() treatment:
.\"     If a select() call is suspended by stop-sig+SIGCONT, the time
.\"     spent suspended is *not* deducted when the select() is restarted.
.\" FIXME: check whether recvmmsg() handles stop-sig+SIGCONT properly.
