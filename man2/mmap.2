.TH MMAP 2 2004-09-11 "Linux 2.6.7" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
mmap, munmap \- map or unmap files or devices into memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/mman.h>
.sp
.BI "void * mmap(void *" start ", size_t " length ", int " prot
.BI ", int " flags ", int " fd ", off_t " offset );
.sp
.BI "int munmap(void *" start ", size_t " length );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mmap
function asks to map
.I length
bytes starting at offset
.I offset
from the file (or other object) specified by the file descriptor
.I fd
into memory, preferably at address
.IR start .
This latter address is a hint only, and is usually specified as 0.
The actual place where the object is mapped is returned by
.BR mmap ,
and is never 0.
.LP
The
.I prot
argument describes the desired memory protection (and must not
conflict with the open mode of the file). It is either
.B PROT_NONE
or is the bitwise OR of one or more of the other PROT_* flags.
.TP 1.1i
.B PROT_EXEC
Pages may be executed.
.TP
.B PROT_READ
Pages may be read.
.TP
.B PROT_WRITE
Pages may be written.
.TP
.B PROT_NONE
Pages may not be accessed.
.LP
The
.I flags
parameter specifies the type of the mapped object, mapping options and
whether modifications made to the mapped copy of the page are private to
the process or are to be shared with other references.  It has bits
.TP 1.1i
.B MAP_FIXED
Do not select a different address than the one specified.
If the specified address cannot be used,
.B mmap
will fail.  If MAP_FIXED is specified,
.I start
must be a multiple of the pagesize.  Use of this option is discouraged.
.TP
.B MAP_SHARED
Share this mapping with all other processes that map this object.
Storing to the region is equivalent to writing to the file.
The file may not actually be updated until
.BR msync (2)
or
.BR munmap (2)
are called.
.TP
.B MAP_PRIVATE
Create a private copy-on-write mapping.
Stores to the region do not affect the original file.
It is unspecified whether changes made to the file after the
.B mmap
call are visible in the mapped region.
.LP
You must specify exactly one of MAP_SHARED and MAP_PRIVATE.
.LP
The above three flags are described in POSIX.1b (formerly POSIX.4) and SUSv2.
Linux also knows about the following non-standard flags:
.TP
.B MAP_DENYWRITE
This flag is ignored.
.\" Introduced in 1.1.36, removed in 1.3.24.
(Long ago, it signalled that attempts to write to the underlying file
should fail with ETXTBUSY. But this was a source of denial-of-service attacks.)
.TP
.B MAP_EXECUTABLE
This flag is ignored.
.\" Introduced in 1.1.38, removed in 1.3.24. Flag tested in proc_follow_link.
.\" (Long ago, it signalled that the underlying file is an executable.
.\" However, that information was not really used anywhere.)
.\" Linus talked about DOS related to MAP_EXECUTABLE, but he was thinking of
.\" MAP_DENYWRITE?
.TP
.B MAP_NORESERVE
(Used together with MAP_PRIVATE.) Do not reserve swap space pages for
this mapping. When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee
that it is possible to modify this private copy-on-write region.
When it is not reserved one might get SIGSEGV upon a write
when no memory is available.
.TP
.BR MAP_LOCKED " (since Linux 2.5.37)"
Lock the pages of the mapped region into memory in the manner of
.BR mlock() .
This flag is ignored in older kernels.
.\" If set, the mapped pages will not be swapped out.
.TP
.B MAP_GROWSDOWN
Used for stacks. Indicates to the kernel VM system that the mapping
should extend downwards in memory.
.TP
.B MAP_ANONYMOUS
The mapping is not backed by any file; the
.I fd
and
.I offset
arguments are ignored.  This flag in conjunction with MAP_SHARED
is implemented since Linux 2.4.
.TP
.B MAP_ANON
Alias for MAP_ANONYMOUS. Deprecated.
.TP
.B MAP_FILE
Compatibility flag. Ignored.
.TP
.B MAP_32BIT
Put the mapping into the first 2GB of the process address space.
Ignored when
.I MAP_FIXED
is set. This flag is currently only supported on x86-64 for 64bit programs.
.TP
.BR MAP_POPULATE " (since Linux 2.5.46)"
Populate (prefault) pagetables.
.TP
.BR MAP_NONBLOCK " (since Linux 2.5.46)"
Do not block on IO.
.LP
Some systems document the additional flags MAP_AUTOGROW, MAP_AUTORESRV,
MAP_COPY, and MAP_LOCAL.
.LP
.I fd
should be a valid file descriptor, unless MAP_ANONYMOUS is set,
in which case the argument is ignored.
.LP
.I offset
should be a multiple of the page size as returned by
.BR getpagesize (2).
.LP
Memory mapped by
.B mmap
is preserved across
.BR fork (2),
with the same attributes.
.LP
A file is mapped in multiples of the page size. For a file that is not
a multiple of the page size, the remaining memory is zeroed when mapped,
and writes to that region are not written out to the file. The effect of
changing the size of the underlying file of a mapping on the pages that
correspond to added or removed regions of the file is unspecified.

The
.B munmap
system call deletes the mappings for the specified address range, and
causes further references to addresses within the range to generate
invalid memory references.  The region is also automatically unmapped
when the process is terminated.  On the other hand, closing the file
descriptor does not unmap the region.
.LP
The address
.I start
must be a multiple of the page size. All pages containing a part
of the indicated range are unmapped, and subsequent references
to these pages will generate SIGSEGV. It is not an error if the
indicated range does not contain any mapped pages.

For file-backed mappings, the
.B st_atime
field for the mapped file may be updated at any time between the
.B mmap()
and the corresponding unmapping; the first reference to a mapped
page will update the field if it has not been already.
.LP
The
.B st_ctime
and
.B st_mtime
field for a file mapped with PROT_WRITE and MAP_SHARED will be updated after
a write to the mapped region, and before a subsequent
.I msync()
with the MS_SYNC or MS_ASYNC flag, if one occurs.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.B mmap
returns a pointer to the mapped area.
On error, the value
.B MAP_FAILED
(that is, (void *) \-1) is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
On success,
.B munmap
returns 0, on failure \-1, and
.I errno
is set (probably to EINVAL).
.SH NOTES
It is architecture dependent whether
.I PROT_READ
includes
.I PROT_EXEC
or not. Portable programs should always set
.I PROT_EXEC
if they intend to execute code in the new mapping.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
A file descriptor refers to a non-regular file.
Or MAP_PRIVATE was requested, but
.I fd
is not open for reading.
Or MAP_SHARED was requested and PROT_WRITE is set, but
.I fd
is not open in read/write (O_RDWR) mode.
Or PROT_WRITE is set, but the file is append-only.
.TP
.B EAGAIN
The file has been locked, or too much memory has been locked.
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor (and MAP_ANONYMOUS was not set).
.TP
.B EINVAL
We don't like
.I start
or
.I length
or
.IR offset .
(E.g., they are too large, or not aligned on a PAGESIZE boundary.)
.\" jbl - not sure this actually happens ? see generic_file_mmap
.TP
.B ENFILE
.\" This is for shared anonymous segments
.\" [2.6.7] shmem_zero_setup()-->shmem_file_setup()-->get_empty_filp()
The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
.\" .TP
.\" .B ENOEXEC
.\" A file could not be mapped for reading.
.TP
.B ENODEV
The underlying filesystem of the specified file does not support
memory mapping.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
No memory is available, or the process's maximum number of mappings would
have been exceeded.
.TP
.B EPERM
The
.I prot
argument asks for
.B PROT_EXEC
but the mapped area belongs to a file on a filesystem that
was mounted no-exec.
.\" (Since 2.4.25 / 2.6.0.)
.TP
.B ETXTBSY
MAP_DENYWRITE was set but the object specified by
.I fd
is open for writing.
.LP
Use of a mapped region can result in these signals:
.TP
.B SIGSEGV
Attempted write into a region specified to mmap as read-only.
.TP
.B SIGBUS
Attempted access to a portion of the buffer that does not correspond
to the file (for example, beyond the end of the file, including the
case where another process has truncated the file).
.SH AVAILABILITY
On POSIX systems on which
.BR mmap ,
.B msync
and
.B munmap
are available,
.B _POSIX_MAPPED_FILES
is defined in <unistd.h> to a value greater than 0. (See also
.BR sysconf (3).)
.\" POSIX 1003.1-2001: It shall be defined to -1 or 0 or 200112L.
.\" -1: unavailable, 0: ask using sysconf().
.\" glibc defines it to 1.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, POSIX.1b (formerly POSIX.4), 4.4BSD, SUSv2.
SVr4 documents additional error codes ENXIO and ENODEV.
SUSv2 documents additional error codes EMFILE and EOVERFLOW.
.SH BUGS
On Linux there are no guarantees like those suggested above
under MAP_NORESERVE. By default, any process can be killed
at any moment when the system runs out of memory.
