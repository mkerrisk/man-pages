.TH CAPABILITIES 7 2004-05-27 "Linux 2.6.6" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
capabilities \- overview of Linux capabilities
.SH DESCRIPTION

For the purpose of performing permission checks,
traditional Unix implementations distinguish two categories of processes:
.I privileged
processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or root),
and
.I unprivileged
processes (whose effective UID is non-zero).
Privileged processes bypass all kernel permission checks,
while unprivileged processes are subject to full permission
checking based on the process's credentials
(usually: effective UID, effective GID, and supplementary group list).

Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux provides an
(as yet incomplete) system of
.IR capabilities ,
which divide the privileges traditionally associated with superuser
into distinct units that can be independently enabled and disabled.
.SS Capabilities List

As at Linux 2.6.6, the following capabilities are implemented:
.TP
.B CAP_CHOWN
Allow arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs (see
.BR chown (2)).
.TP
.B CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
Bypass file read, write, and execute permission checks.
(DAC = "discretionary access control".)
.TP
.B CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
Bypass file read permission checks and
directory read and execute permission checks.
.TP
.B CAP_FOWNER
Bypass permission checks on operations that normally
require the file system UID of the process to match the UID of
the file (e.g.,
.BR chmod (2),
.BR utime (2)),
excluding those operations covered by the
.B CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
and
.BR CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH ;
set extended file attributes (see
.BR chattr (1))
on arbitrary files;
set Access Control Lists (ACLs) on arbitrary files;
ignore directory sticky bit on file deletion.
.TP
.B CAP_FSETID
Don't clear set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits when a file is modified;
permit setting of the set-group-ID bit for a file whose GID does not match
the file system or any of the supplementary GIDs of the calling process.

.SS Process Capabilities
Each process has three capability sets containing zero or more
of the above capabilities:
.TP
.IR Effective :
the capabilities used by the kernel to
perform permission checks for the process.
.TP
.IR Permitted :
the capabilities that the process may assume
(i.e., a limiting superset for the effective and inheritable sets).
If a process drops a capability from its permitted set,
it can never re-acquire that capability (unless it execs a
set-UID-root program).
.TP
.IR Inherited :
the capabilities preserved across an
.BR execve (2).
.PP
In the current implementation, a process is granted all permitted and
effective capabilities (subject to the operation of the
capability bounding set described below)
when it execs a set-UID-root program,
or if a process with a real UID of zero execs a new program.
.PP
A child created via
.BR fork (2)
inherits copies of its parent's capability sets.
.PP
Using
.BR capset (2),
a process may manipulate its own capability sets, or, if it has the
.B CAP_SETPCAP
capability, those of another process.

.SS Capability bounding set
When a program is execed, the permitted and  effective capabities are ANDed
with the current value of the so-called
.IR "capability bounding set" ,
defined in the file
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound .
This parameter can be used to place a system-wide limit on the
capabilities granted to all subsequently executed programs.
(Confusingly, this bit mask parameter is expressed as a
signed decimal number in
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound .)

Only the
.B init
process may set bits in the capability bounding set;
other than that, the superuser may only clear bits in this set.

On a standard system the capability bounding set always masks out the
.B CAP_SETPCAP
capability.
To remove this restriction, modify the definition of
.B CAP_INIT_EFF_SET
in
.I include/linux/capability.h
and rebuild the kernel.

.SS Current and Future Implementation
A full implementation of capabilities requires:
.IP 1. 4
that for all privileged operations,
the kernel check whether the process has the required
capability in its effective set.
.IP 2. 4
that the kernel provide 
system calls allowing a process's capability sets to
be changed and retrieved.
.IP 3. 4
file system support for attaching capabilities to an executable file,
so that a process gains those capabilities when the file is execed.
.PP
As at Linux 2.6.6, only the first two of these requirements are met.

Eventually, it should be possible to associate three 
capability sets with an executable file, which,
in conjunction with the capability sets of the process,
will determine the capabilities of a process after an
.IR exec :
.TP
.IR Allowed :
this set is ANDed with the process's inherited set to determine which
inherited capabilities are permitted to the process after the exec.
.TP
.IR Forced :
the capabilities automatically permitted to the process,
regardless of the process's inherited capabilities.
.TP
.IR Effective :
those capabilities in the process's new permitted set are
also to be set in the new effective set.
(F(effective) would normally be either all zeroes or all ones.)
.PP
In the meantime, since the current implementation does not
support file capability sets, during an exec:
.IP 1. 4
All three file capability sets are initially assumed to be cleared.
.IP 2. 4
If a set-UID-root program is being execed,
or the real user ID of the process is 0 (root)
then the file allowed and forced sets are defined to be all ones
(i.e., all capabilities set).
.IP 3. 4
If a set-UID-root program is being executed,
then the file effective set is defined to be all ones.
.PP
During an exec, the kernel calculates the new capabilities of
the process using the following algorithm:
.in +4
.nf

P'(permitted) = (P(inherited) & F(allowed)) | (F(forced) & cap_bset)

P'(effective) = P'(permitted) & F(effective)

P'(inherited) = P(inherited)    [i.e., unchanged]

.fi
.in -4
where:
.IP P 10
denotes the value of a process capability set before the exec
.IP P' 10
denotes the value of a capability set after the exec
.IP F 10
denotes a file capability set
.IP cap_bset 10
is the value of the capability bounding set.
.SH NOTES
The
.I libcap
package provides a suite of routines for setting and
getting process capabilities that is more comfortable and less likely
to change than the interface provided by
.BR capset (2)
and
.BR capget (2).
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
No standards govern capabilities, but the Linux capability implementation
is based on the withdrawn POSIX 1003.1e draft standard.
.SH BUGS
There is as yet no file system support allowing capabilities to be
associated with executable files.
