.TH PROC 5 2013-12-30 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
proc \- process information pseudo-filesystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I proc
filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to
kernel data structures.
It is commonly mounted at
.IR /proc .
Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be
changed.
.LP
The following list describes many of the files and directories under the
.I /proc
hierarchy.
.PD 1
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]
There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the
subdirectory is named by the process ID.
Each such subdirectory contains the following
pseudo-files and directories.
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/attr and
.\"       /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/attr
.\"	  This is a directory
.\"       Added in ???
.\"	  CONFIG_SECURITY
.\"
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/auxv " (since 2.6.0-test7)"
This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter information passed
to the process at exec time.
The format is one \fIunsigned long\fP ID
plus one \fIunsigned long\fP value for each entry.
The last entry contains two zeros.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/cgroup " (since Linux 2.6.24)"
.\" 	  Info in Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt
This file describes control groups to which the process/task belongs.
For each cgroup hierarchy there is one entry containing
colon-separated fields of the form:
.nf
.ft CW

    5:cpuacct,cpu,cpuset:/daemons
.ft
.fi
.IP
The colon-separated fields are, from left to right:
.RS 11
.IP 1. 3
hierarchy ID number
.IP 2.
set of subsystems bound to the hierarchy
.IP 3.
control group in the hierarchy to which the process belongs
.RE
.IP
This file is present only if the
.B CONFIG_CGROUPS
kernel configuration option is enabled.
.\"
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/clear_refs
.\"       Added in 2.6.22
.\"       "Clears page referenced bits shown in smaps output"
.\"       write-only
.\"       CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/cmdline
This holds the complete command line for the process,
unless the process is a zombie.
.\" In 2.3.26, this also used to be true if the process was swapped out.
In the latter case, there is nothing in this file:
that is, a read on this file will return 0 characters.
The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of
strings separated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
with a further null byte after the last string.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/coredump_filter " (since kernel 2.6.23)"
See
.BR core (5).
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/cpuset " (since kernel 2.6.12)"
.\" and/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/cpuset
See
.BR cpuset (7).
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/cwd
This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.
To find out the current working directory of process 20,
for instance, you can do this:

.in +4n
.nf
.RB "$" " cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd"
.fi
.in

Note that the
.I pwd
command is often a shell built-in, and might
not work properly.
In
.BR bash (1),
you may use
.IR "pwd\ \-P" .

.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/environ
This file contains the environment for the process.
The entries are separated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
and there may be a null byte at the end.
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:
.in +4n
.nf

.ft CW
.RB "$" " strings /proc/1/environ"
.fi
.ft P
.in
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link
containing the actual pathname of the executed command.
This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open
it will open the executable.
You can even type
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
to run another copy of the same executable as is being run by
process [pid].
.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).

Under Linux 2.0 and earlier
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
is a pointer to the binary which was executed,
and appears as a symbolic link.
A
.BR readlink (2)
call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a string in the format:

    [device]:inode

For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE,
MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition on the first drive).

.BR find (1)
with the
.I \-inum
option can be used to locate the file.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/fd/
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a
symbolic link to the actual file.
Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, etc.

For file descriptors for pipes and sockets,
the entries will be symbolic links whose content is the
file type with the inode.
A
.BR readlink (2)
call on this file returns a string in the format:

    type:[inode]

For example,
.I socket:[2248868]
will be a socket and its inode is 2248868.
For sockets, that inode can be used to find more information
in one of the files under
.IR /proc/net/ .

For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode
(e.g., file descriptors produced by
.BR epoll_create (2),
.BR eventfd (2),
.BR inotify_init (2),
.BR signalfd (2),
and
.BR timerfd (2)),
the entry will be a symbolic link with contents of the form

    anon_inode:<file-type>

In some cases, the
.I file-type
is surrounded by square brackets.

For example, an epoll file descriptor will have a symbolic link
whose content is the string
.IR "anon_inode:[eventpoll]" .

.\"The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).

Programs that will take a filename as a command-line argument,
but will not take input from standard input if no argument is supplied,
or that write to a file named as a command-line argument,
but will not send their output to standard output
if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless be made to use
standard input or standard out using
.IR /proc/[pid]/fd .
For example, assuming that
.I \-i
is the flag designating an input file and
.I \-o
is the flag designating an output file:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " foobar \-i /proc/self/fd/0 \-o /proc/self/fd/1 ..."
.fi
.in

and you have a working filter.
.\" The following is not true in my tests (MTK):
.\" Note that this will not work for
.\" programs that seek on their files, as the files in the fd directory
.\" are not seekable.

.I /proc/self/fd/N
is approximately the same as
.I /dev/fd/N
in some UNIX and UNIX-like systems.
Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link
.I /dev/fd
to
.IR /proc/self/fd ,
in fact.

Most systems provide symbolic links
.IR /dev/stdin ,
.IR /dev/stdout ,
and
.IR /dev/stderr ,
which respectively link to the files
.IR 0 ,
.IR 1 ,
and
.IR 2
in
.IR /proc/self/fd .
Thus the example command above could be written as:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " foobar \-i /dev/stdin \-o /dev/stdout ..."
.fi
.in
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/loginuid

.\"       CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/fdinfo/ " (since kernel 2.6.22)"
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor.
The contents of each file can be read to obtain information
about the corresponding file descriptor, for example:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4"
pos:    1000
flags:  01002002
.fi
.in

The
.I pos
field is a decimal number showing the current file offset.
The
.I flags
field is an octal number that displays the
file access mode and file status flags (see
.BR open (2)).

The files in this directory are readable only by the owner of the process.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/io " (since kernel 2.6.20)"
.\" commit 7c3ab7381e79dfc7db14a67c6f4f3285664e1ec2
This file contains I/O statistics for the process, for example:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "#" " cat /proc/3828/io"
rchar: 323934931
wchar: 323929600
syscr: 632687
syscw: 632675
read_bytes: 0
write_bytes: 323932160
cancelled_write_bytes: 0
.fi
.in

The fields are as follows:
.RS
.TP
.IR rchar ": characters read"
The number of bytes which this task has caused to be read from storage.
This is simply the sum of bytes which this process passed to
.BR read (2)
and similar system calls.
It includes things such as terminal I/O and
is unaffected by whether or not actual
physical disk I/O was required (the read might have been satisfied from
pagecache).
.TP
.IR wchar ": characters written"
The number of bytes which this task has caused, or shall cause to be written
to disk.
Similar caveats apply here as with
.IR rchar .
.TP
.IR syscr ": read syscalls"
Attempt to count the number of read I/O operations\(emthat is,
system calls such as
.BR read (2)
and
.BR pread (2).
.TP
.IR syscw ": write syscalls"
Attempt to count the number of write I/O operations\(emthat is,
system calls such as
.BR write (2)
and
.BR pwrite (2).
.TP
.IR read_bytes ": bytes read"
Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process really did cause to
be fetched from the storage layer.
This is accurate for block-backed filesystems.
.TP
.IR write_bytes ": bytes written"
Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process caused to be sent to
the storage layer.
.TP
.IR cancelled_write_bytes :
The big inaccuracy here is truncate.
If a process writes 1MB to a file and then deletes the file,
it will in fact perform no writeout.
But it will have been accounted as having caused 1MB of write.
In other words: this field represents the number of bytes which this process
caused to not happen, by truncating pagecache.
A task can cause "negative" I/O too.
If this task truncates some dirty pagecache,
some I/O which another task has been accounted for
(in its
.IR write_bytes )
will not be happening.
.RE
.IP
.IR Note :
In the current implementation, things are a bit racy on 32-bit systems:
if process A reads process B's
.I /proc/[pid]/io
while process B is updating one of these 64-bit counters,
process A could see an intermediate result.
.RE
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/limits " (since kernel 2.6.24)"
This file displays the soft limit, hard limit, and units of measurement
for each of the process's resource limits (see
.BR getrlimit (2)).
Up to and including Linux 2.6.35,
this file is protected to allow reading only by the real UID of the process.
Since Linux 2.6.36,
.\" commit 3036e7b490bf7878c6dae952eec5fb87b1106589
this file is readable by all users on the system.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/map_files/ " (since kernel 3.3)
.\" commit 640708a2cff7f81e246243b0073c66e6ece7e53e
This subdirectory contains entries corresponding to memory-mapped
files (see
.BR mmap (2)).
Entries are named by memory region start and end
address pair (expressed as hexadecimal numbers),
and are symbolic links to the mapped files themselves.
Here is an example, with the output wrapped and reformatted to fit on an 80-column display:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " ls -l /proc/self/map_files/"
lr\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-. 1 root root 64 Apr 16 21:31
            3252e00000\-3252e20000 \-> /usr/lib64/ld-2.15.so
\&...
.fi
.in

Although these entries are present for memory regions that were
mapped with  the
.BR MAP_FILE
flag, the way anonymous shared memory (regions created with the
.B MAP_ANON | MAP_SHARED
flags)
is implemented in Linux
means that such regions also appear on this directory.
Here is an example where the target file is the deleted
.I /dev/zero
one:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB
lrw\-\-\-\-\-\-\-. 1 root root 64 Apr 16 21:33
            7fc075d2f000\-7fc075e6f000 \-> /dev/zero (deleted)
.fi
.in

This directory appears only if the
.B CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE
kernel configuration option is enabled.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/maps
A file containing the currently mapped memory regions and their access
permissions.
See
.BR mmap (2)
for some further information about memory mappings.

The format of the file is:

The
.I address
field is the address space in the process that the mapping occupies.
The
.I perms
field is a set of permissions:

.nf
.in +5
r = read
w = write
x = execute
s = shared
p = private (copy on write)
.fi
.in

The
.I offset
field is the offset into the file/whatever;
.I dev
is the device
(major:minor);
.I inode
is the inode on that device.
0 indicates that no inode is associated with the memory region,
as would be the case with BSS (uninitialized data).

The
.I pathname
field will usually be the file that is backing the mapping.
For ELF files,
you can easily coordinate with the
.I offset
field by looking at the
Offset field in the ELF program headers
.RI ( "readelf\ \-l" ).

There are additional helpful pseudo-paths:
.RS 12
.TP
.IR [stack]
The initial process's (also known as the main thread's) stack.
.TP
.IR [stack:<tid>] " (since Linux 3.4)"
.\" commit b76437579d1344b612cf1851ae610c636cec7db0
A thread's stack (where the
.IR <tid>
is a thread ID).
It corresponds to the
.IR /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/
path.
.TP
.IR [vdso]
The virtual dynamically linked shared object.
.TP
.IR [heap]
The process's heap.
.in
.fi
.RE
.IP
If the
.I pathname
field is blank,
this is an anonymous mapping as obtained via the
.BR mmap (2)
function.
There is no easy way to coordinate this back to a process's source,
short of running it through
.BR gdb (1),
.BR strace (1),
or similar.

Under Linux 2.0 there is no field giving pathname.
.TP

This file can be used to adjust the score used to select which process
should be killed in an out-of-memory (OOM) situation.
The kernel uses this value for a bit-shift operation of the process's

value:
valid values are in the range \-16 to +15,
plus the special value \-17,
which disables OOM-killing altogether for this process.
A positive score increases the likelihood of this
process being killed by the OOM-killer;
a negative score decreases the likelihood.

.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj " (since Linux 2.6.36)"
.\" Text taken from 3.7 Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used to select which
process gets killed in out-of-memory conditions.

The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from 0
(never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is targeted.
The units are roughly a proportion along that range of
allowed memory the process may allocate from,
based on an estimation of its current memory and swap use.
For example, if a task is using all allowed memory,
its badness score will be 1000.
If it is using half of its allowed memory, its score will be 500.

There is an additional factor included in the badness score: root
processes are given 3% extra memory over other tasks.

The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context
in which the OOM-killer was called.
If it is due to the memory assigned to the allocating task's cpuset
being exhausted,
the allowed memory represents the set of mems assigned to that
cpuset (see
.BR cpuset (7)).
If it is due to a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted,
the allowed memory represents the set of mempolicy nodes.
If it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being reached,
the allowed memory is that configured limit.
Finally, if it is due to the entire system being out of memory, the
allowed memory represents all allocatable resources.

The value of
.I oom_score_adj
is added to the badness score before it
is used to determine which task to kill.
Acceptable values range from \-1000
(OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to +1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX).
This allows user space to control the preference for OOM-killing,
ranging from always preferring a certain
task or completely disabling it from OOM-killing.
The lowest possible value, \-1000, is
equivalent to disabling OOM-killing entirely for that task,
since it will always report a badness score of 0.

Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define
the amount of memory to consider for each task.
Setting a
.I oom_score_adj
value of +500, for example,
is roughly equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the
same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller resources
to use at least 50% more memory.
A value of \-500, on the other hand, would be roughly
equivalent to discounting 50% of the task's
allowed memory from being considered as scoring against the task.

For backward compatibility with previous kernels,
.I /proc/[pid]/oom_adj
can still be used to tune the badness score.
Its value is
scaled linearly with
.IR oom_score_adj .

Writing to
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj
or
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_adj
will change the other with its scaled value.

The kernel stores nice values as numbers
in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low),

.IR /proc/config.gz " (since Linux 2.6)"
This file exposes the configuration options that were used
to build the currently running kernel,
in the same format as they would be shown in the
.I .config
file that resulted when configuring the kernel (using
.IR "make xconfig" ,
.IR "make config" ,
or similar).
The file contents are compressed; view or search them using
.BR zcat (1),
.BR zgrep (1),
etc.
As long as no changes have been made to the following file,
the contents of

.I /proc/cpuinfo
This is a collection of CPU and system architecture dependent items,
for each supported architecture a different list.
Two common entries are \fIprocessor\fP which gives CPU number and
\fIbogomips\fP; a system constant that is calculated
during kernel initialization.
SMP machines have information for
each CPU.
The

.I /proc/filesystems
A text listing of the filesystems which are supported by the kernel,
namely filesystems which were compiled into the kernel or whose kernel
modules are currently loaded.
(See also
.BR filesystems (5).)
If a filesystem is marked with "nodev",
this means that it does not require a block device to be mounted
(e.g., virtual filesystem, network filesystem).

Incidentally, this file may be used by
.BR mount (8)
when no filesystem is specified and it didn't manage to determine the
filesystem type.
Then filesystems contained in this file are tried
(excepted those that are marked with "nodev").
.TP

.I /proc/interrupts
This is used to record the number of interrupts per CPU per IO device.
Since Linux 2.6.24,
for the i386 and x86_64 architectures, at least, this also includes
interrupts internal to the system (that is, not associated with a device
as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable interrupt), LOC (local timer interrupt),
and for SMP systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and possibly others.
Very easy to read formatting, done in ASCII.

.IR /proc/kallsyms " (since Linux 2.5.71)"
This holds the kernel exported symbol definitions used by the
.BR modules (X)
tools to dynamically link and bind loadable modules.
In Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly different syntax
was named
.IR ksyms .
.TP
.I /proc/kcore
This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored
in the ELF core file format.
With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped
kernel
.RI ( /usr/src/linux/vmlinux )
binary, GDB can be used to
examine the current state of any kernel data structures.

The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus
4KB.
.TP
.I /proc/kmsg
This file can be used instead of the
.BR syslog (2)
system call to read kernel messages.
A process must have superuser
privileges to read this file, and only one process should read this
file.
This file should not be read if a syslog process is running
which uses the
.BR syslog (2)
system call facility to log kernel messages.

Information in this file is retrieved with the
.BR dmesg (1)
program.
.TP
.IR /proc/ksyms " (Linux 1.1.23-2.5.47)"

.I /proc/loadavg
The first three fields in this file are load average figures
giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R)
or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
They are the same as the load average numbers given by
.BR uptime (1)
and other programs.
The fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).
The first of these is the number of currently runnable kernel
scheduling entities (processes, threads).
The value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities
that currently exist on the system.
The fifth field is the PID of the process that was most
recently created on the system.
.TP
.I /proc/locks

.TP
.I /proc/meminfo
This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system.
It is used by
.BR free (1)
to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap)
on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the
kernel.
Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon,
the value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., "kB").
The list below describes the parameter names and
the format specifier required to read the field value.
Except as noted below,
all of the fields have been present since at least Linux 2.6.0.
Some fileds are displayed only if the kernel was configured
with various options; those dependencies are noted in the list.

.IR MemTotal " %lu"
Total usable RAM (i.e., physical RAM minus a few reserved
bits and the kernel binary code).
.TP
.IR MemFree " %lu"
The sum of
.IR LowFree + HighFree .
.TP
.IR Buffers " %lu"
Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks that
shouldn't get tremendously large (20MB or so).
.TP
.IR Cached " %lu"
In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the page cache).
Doesn't include
.IR SwapCached .
.TP
.IR SwapCached " %lu"
Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but
still also is in the swap file.
(If memory pressure is high, these pages
don't need to be swapped out again because they are already
in the swap file.
This saves I/O.)
.TP
.IR Active " %lu"
Memory that has been used more recently and usually not
reclaimed unless absolutely necessary.
.TP
.IR Inactive " %lu"
Memory which has been less recently used.
It is more eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes.

.TP
.IR HighTotal " %lu"
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)
Total amount of highmem.
Highmem is all memory above ~860MB of physical memory.
Highmem areas are for use by user-space programs,
or for the page cache.
The kernel must use tricks to access
this memory, making it slower to access than lowmem.
.TP
.IR HighFree " %lu
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)
Amount of free highmem.
.TP
.IR LowTotal " %lu
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)
Total amount of lowmem.
Lowmem is memory which can be used for everything that
highmem can be used for, but it is also available for the
kernel's use for its own data structures.
Among many other things,
it is where everything from
.I Slab
is allocated.
Bad things happen when you're out of lowmem.
.TP
.IR LowFree " %lu
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)

.TP
.IR KernelStack " %lu (since Linux 2.6.32)"
Amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks.
.TP
.IR PageTables " %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)"
Amount of memory dedicated to the lowest level of page tables.
.TP

.TP
.IR NFS_Unstable " %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)"
NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet committed to stable storage.
.TP
.IR Bounce " %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)"
Memory used for block device "bounce buffers".
.TP
.IR WritebackTmp " %lu (since Linux 2.6.26)"
Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers.
.TP
.IR CommitLimit " %lu (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Based on the overcommit ratio ('vm.overcommit_ratio'),
this is the total amount of  memory currently available to
be allocated on the system.
This limit is adhered to
only if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio ).
The
.I CommitLimit
is calculated using the following formula:

    CommitLimit =
        ([total RAM pages] - [total huge TLB pages]) *
        overcommit_ratio / 100 + [total swap pages]

For example, on a system with 1GB of physical RAM and 7GB
of swap with a
.I overcommit_ratio
of 30, this formula yields a
.I CommitLimit
of 7.3GB.
For more details, see the memory overcommit documentation
in the kernel source file
.IR Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting .
.TP
.IR Committed_AS " %lu"
The amount of memory presently allocated on the system.
The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which
has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been
"used" by them as of yet.
A process which allocates 1GB of memory (using
.BR malloc (3)
or similar), but touches only 300MB of that memory will show up
as using only 300MB of memory even if it has the address space
allocated for the entire 1GB.
This 1GB is memory which has been "committed" to by the VM
and can be used at any time by the allocating application.
With strict overcommit enabled on the system (mode 2
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory ),
allocations which would exceed the
.I CommitLimit
(detailed above) will not be permitted.
This is useful if one needs to guarantee that processes will not
fail due to lack of memory once that memory has been successfully allocated.
.TP
.IR VmallocTotal " %lu"
Total size of vmalloc memory area.
.TP
.IR VmallocUsed " %lu"
Amount of vmalloc area which is used.
.TP
.IR VmallocChunk " %lu"
Largest contiguous block of vmalloc area which is free.
.TP

(\fBCONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE\fP is required.)
[To be documented.]
.TP
.IR AnonHugePages " %lu (since Linux 2.6.38)"
(\fBCONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE\fP is required.)
Non-file backed huge pages mapped into user-space page tables.
.TP
.IR HugePages_Total " %lu"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
The size of the pool of huge pages.
.TP
.IR HugePages_Free " %lu"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
The number of huge pages in the pool that are not yet allocated.
.TP
.IR HugePages_Rsvd " %lu (since Linux 2.6.17)"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
This is the number of huge pages for
which a commitment to allocate from the pool has been made,
but no allocation has yet been made.
These reserved huge pages
guarantee that an application will be able to allocate a
huge page from the pool of huge pages at fault time.
.TP
.IR HugePages_Surp " %lu (since Linux 2.6.24)"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
This is the number of huge pages in
the pool above the value in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages .
The maximum number of surplus huge pages is controlled by
.IR /proc/sys/vm/nr_overcommit_hugepages .
.TP
.IR Hugepagesize " %lu"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
The size of huge pages.

.BR lsmod (8).
.TP
.I /proc/mounts
Before kernel 2.4.19, this file was a list
of all the filesystems currently mounted on the system.
With the introduction of per-process mount namespaces in
Linux 2.4.19, this file became a link to
.IR /proc/self/mounts ,
which lists the mount points of the process's own mount namespace.
The format of this file is documented in
.BR fstab (5).
.TP
.I /proc/mtrr
Memory Type Range Registers.
See the Linux kernel source file
.I Documentation/mtrr.txt
for details.
.TP
.I /proc/net
various net pseudo-files, all of which give the status of some part of
the networking layer.
These files contain ASCII structures and are,
therefore, readable with
.BR cat (1).
However, the standard
.BR netstat (8)
suite provides much cleaner access to these files.
.TP
.I /proc/net/arp
This holds an ASCII readable dump of the kernel ARP table used for
address resolutions.
It will show both dynamically learned and preprogrammed ARP entries.
The format is:

.nf

.ft
.fi
.in

Here "IP address" is the IPv4 address of the machine and the "HW type"
is the hardware type of the address from RFC\ 826.
The flags are the internal
flags of the ARP structure (as defined in
.IR /usr/include/linux/if_arp.h )
and
the "HW address" is the data link layer mapping for that IP address if
it is known.
.TP
.I /proc/net/dev
The dev pseudo-file contains network device status information.

Every directory contains one file per registered host.
Every host-file is named after the number the host was assigned during

.IR /proc/sys/fs/file-max ).
If the number of allocated file handles is close to the
maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum.
Before Linux 2.6,
the kernel allocated file handles dynamically,
but it didn't free them again.
Instead the free file handles were kept in a list for reallocation;
the "free file handles" value indicates the size of that list.
A large number of free file handles indicates that there was

Setting the value to 1

The common method of exploiting this flaw
is to cross privilege boundaries when following a given hard link

Additionally, on systems without separated partitions,
this stops unauthorized users from "pinning" vulnerable set-user-ID and

If this file contains 0, then the system
tries to continue operation.
If it contains 1, then the system
delays a few seconds (to give klogd time to record the oops output)

The default value for this file, 32768,
results in the same range of PIDs as on earlier kernels.
On 32-bit platforms, 32768 is the maximum value for
.IR pid_max .
On 64-bit systems,
.I pid_max
can be set to any value up to 2^22

.IR /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced " (since Linux 3.1)"
.\" commit b34a6b1da371ed8af1221459a18c67970f7e3d53
.\" See also Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt
If this file is set to 1, all System V shared memory segments will
be marked for destruction as soon as the number of attached processes
falls to zero;
in other words, it is no longer possible to create shared memory segments
that exist independently of any attached process.
.IP
The effect is as though a
.BR shmctl (2)
.B IPC_RMID
is performed on all existing  segments as well as all segments
created in the future (until this file is reset to 0).
Note that existing segments that are attached to no process will be
immediately destroyed when this file is set to 1.
Setting this option will also destroy segments that were created,
but never attached,
upon termination of the process that created the segment with
.BR shmget (2).
.IP
Setting this file to 1 provides a way of ensuring that
all System V shared memory segments are counted against the
resource usage and resource limits (see the description of
.B RLIMIT_AS
in
.BR getrlimit (2))
of at least one process.
.IP
Because setting this file to 1 produces behavior that is nonstandard
and could also break existing applications,
the default value in this file is 0.
Only set this file to 1 if you have a good understanding
of the semantics of the applications using
System V shared memory on your system.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/kernel/shmall

.I /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
This file
can be used to query and set the run-time limit
on the maximum (System V IPC) shared memory segment size that can be
created.
Shared memory segments up to 1GB are now supported in the
kernel.
This value defaults to
.BR SHMMAX .

.IR /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni " (since Linux 2.4)"
This file
specifies the system-wide maximum number of System V shared memory
segments that can be created.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
This file controls the functions allowed to be invoked by the SysRq key.
By default,
the file contains 1 meaning that every possible SysRq request is allowed
(in older kernel versions, SysRq was disabled by default,
and you were required to specifically enable it at run-time,
but this is not the case any more).
Possible values in this file are:

   0 - disable sysrq completely
   1 - enable all functions of sysrq
  >1 - bit mask of allowed sysrq functions, as follows:
          2 - enable control of console logging level
          4 - enable control of keyboard (SAK, unraw)
          8 - enable debugging dumps of processes etc.
         16 - enable sync command
         32 - enable remount read-only
         64 - enable signalling of processes (term, kill, oom-kill)
        128 - allow reboot/poweroff

.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches " (since Linux 2.6.16)"
Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries, and
inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.
This can be useful for memory management testing and
performing reproducible filesystem benchmarks.
Because writing to this file causes the benefits of caching to be lost,
it can degrade overall system performance.

To free pagecache, use:

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

To free dentries and inodes, use:

    echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

To free pagecache, dentries and inodes, use:

    echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

Because writing to this file is a nondestructive operation and dirty objects
are not freeable, the
user should run
.BR sync (8)
first.

.IR /proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill " (since Linux 2.6.32)"
.\" The following is based on the text in Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
Control how to kill processes when an uncorrected memory error
(typically a 2-bit error in a memory module)
that cannot be handled by the kernel
is detected in the background by hardware.
In some cases (like the page still having a valid copy on disk),
the kernel will handle the failure
transparently without affecting any applications.
But if there is no other up-to-date copy of the data,
it will kill processes to prevent any data corruptions from propagating.

The file has one of the following values:
.RS
.IP 1: 4
Kill all processes that have the corrupted-and-not-reloadable page mapped
as soon as the corruption is detected.
Note this is not supported for a few types of pages, like kernel internally
allocated data or the swap cache, but works for the majority of user pages.
.IP 0: 4
Only unmap the corrupted page from all processes and kill only a process
that tries to access it.
.RE
.IP
The kill is performed using a
.B SIGBUS
signal with
.I si_code
set to
.BR BUS_MCEERR_AO .
Processes can handle this if they want to; see
.BR sigaction (2)
for more details.

This feature is active only on architectures/platforms with advanced machine
check handling and depends on the hardware capabilities.

Applications can override the
.I memory_failure_early_kill

.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
.\" The following is from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
Enables a system-wide task dump (excluding kernel threads) to be
produced when the kernel performs an OOM-killing.
The dump includes the following information
for each task (thread, process):
thread ID, real user ID, thread group ID (process ID),
virtual memory size, resident set size,
the CPU that the task is scheduled on,
oom_adj score (see the description of
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_adj ),
and command name.
This is helpful to determine why the OOM-killer was invoked
and to identify the rogue task that caused it.

If this contains the value zero, this information is suppressed.
On very large systems with thousands of tasks,
it may not be feasible to dump the memory state information for each one.
Such systems should not be forced to incur a performance penalty in
OOM situations when the information may not be desired.

If this is set to nonzero, this information is shown whenever the
OOM-killer actually kills a memory-hogging task.

The default value is 0.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task " (since Linux 2.6.24)"
.\" The following is from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
This enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering task in
out-of-memory situations.

If this is set to zero, the OOM-killer will scan through the entire
tasklist and select a task based on heuristics to kill.
This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging task that
frees up a large amount of memory when killed.

If this is set to nonzero, the OOM-killer simply kills the task that
triggered the out-of-memory condition.
This avoids a possibly expensive tasklist scan.

If
.I /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom
is nonzero, it takes precedence over whatever value is used in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task .

The default value is 0.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode.

.RS
.IP
0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
.br
1: always overcommit, never check
.br
2: always check, never overcommit
.RE
.IP
In mode 0, calls of
.BR mmap (2)
with
.B MAP_NORESERVE
are not checked, and the default check is very weak,
leading to the risk of getting a process "OOM-killed".
Under Linux 2.4 any nonzero value implies mode 1.
In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space
on the system is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)),
where SS is the size of the swap space, and RAM
is the size of the physical memory, and r is the contents of the file

.IR /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom " (since Linux 2.6.18)"
.\" The following is adapted from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
This enables or disables a kernel panic in
an out-of-memory situation.

If this file is set to the value 0,
the kernel's OOM-killer will kill some rogue process.
Usually, the OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the
system will survive.

If this file is set to the value 1,
then the kernel normally panics when out-of-memory happens.
However, if a process limits allocations to certain nodes
using memory policies
.RB ( mbind  (2)
.BR MPOL_BIND )
or cpusets
.RB ( cpuset (7))
and those nodes reach memory exhaustion status,
one process may be killed by the OOM-killer.
No panic occurs in this case:
because other nodes' memory may be free,
this means the system as a whole may not have reached
an out-of-memory situation yet.

If this file is set to the value 2,
the kernel always panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

The default value is 0.
1 and 2 are for failover of clustering.
Select either according to your policy of failover.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
