.SH NAME
signbit \- test sign of a real floating point number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <math.h>"
.sp
.BI  "int signbit (" X ");"
.sp
Link with \-lm.
.SH DESCRIPTION
`signbit' is a generic macro which can work on all real floating-point
types.  It returns a nonzero value if the value of X has its sign
bit set.
.PP
This is not the same as `x < 0.0', because IEEE 754 floating point
allows zero to be signed.  The comparison `-0.0 < 0.0' is false,
but `signbit (-0.0)' will return a nonzero value.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appendix with
recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).
