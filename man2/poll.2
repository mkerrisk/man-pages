.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR poll ()
performs a similar task to
.BR select (2):
it waits for one of a set of file descriptors to become ready
to perform I/O.

The set of file descriptors to be monitored is specified in the
.I fds
argument, which is an array of structures of the following form:
.in +4n
.nf

struct pollfd {
    int   fd;         /* file descriptor */
    short events;     /* requested events */
    short revents;    /* returned events */
};
.in
.fi
.PP
The caller should specify the number of items in the
.I fds
array in
.IR nfds .

The field
.I fd
contains a file descriptor for an open file.
If this field is negative, then the corresponding
.I events
field is ignored and the
.I revents
field returns zero.
(This provides an easy way of ignoring a
file descriptor for a single
.BR poll ()
call: simply negate the
.I fd
field.)

The field
.I events
is an input parameter, a bit mask specifying the events the application
is interested in.

The field
.I revents
is an output parameter, filled by the kernel with the events that
actually occurred.
The bits returned in
.I revents
can include any of those specified in
.IR events ,
or one of the values
.BR POLLERR ,
.BR POLLHUP ,
or
.BR POLLNVAL .
(These three bits are meaningless in the
.I events
field, and will be set in the
.I revents
field whenever the corresponding condition is true.)

If none of the events requested (and no error) has occurred for any
of the file descriptors, then
.BR poll ()
blocks until one of the events occurs.

The
.I timeout
argument specifies an upper limit on the time for which
.BR poll ()
will block, in milliseconds.
Specifying a negative value in
.I timeout
means an infinite timeout.

The bits that may be set/returned in
.I events
and
.I revents
are defined in \fI<poll.h>\fP:
.RS
.TP
.B POLLIN
There is data to read.
.TP
.B POLLPRI
There is urgent data to read (e.g., out-of-band data on TCP socket;
pseudoterminal master in packet mode has seen state change in slave).
.TP
.B POLLOUT
Writing now will not block.
.TP
.BR POLLRDHUP " (since Linux 2.6.17)"
Stream socket peer closed connection,
or shut down writing half of connection.
The
.B _GNU_SOURCE
feature test macro must be defined
(before including
.I any
header files)
in order to obtain this definition.
.TP
.B POLLERR
Error condition (output only).
.TP
.B POLLHUP
Hang up (output only).
.TP
.B POLLNVAL
Invalid request:
.I fd
not open (output only).
.RE
.PP
When compiling with
.B _XOPEN_SOURCE
defined, one also has the following,
which convey no further information beyond the bits listed above:
.RS
.TP
.B POLLRDNORM
Equivalent to
.BR POLLIN .
.TP
.B POLLRDBAND
Priority band data can be read (generally unused on Linux).
.\" POLLRDBAND is used in the DECnet protocol.
.TP
.B POLLWRNORM
Equivalent to
.BR POLLOUT .
.TP
.B POLLWRBAND
Priority data may be written.
.RE
.PP
Linux also knows about, but does not use
.BR POLLMSG .
.SS ppoll()
The relationship between
.BR poll ()
and
.BR ppoll ()
is analogous to the relationship between
.BR select (2)
and
.BR pselect (2):
like
.BR pselect (2),
.BR ppoll ()
allows an application to safely wait until either a file descriptor
becomes ready or until a signal is caught.
.PP
Other than the difference in the precision of the
.I timeout
argument, the following
.BR ppoll ()
call:
.nf

    ready = ppoll(&fds, nfds, timeout_ts, &sigmask);

.fi
is equivalent to
.I atomically
executing the following calls:
.nf

    sigset_t origmask;
    int timeout;

    timeout = (timeout_ts == NULL) ? \-1 :
              (timeout_ts.tv_sec * 1000 + timeout_ts.tv_nsec / 1000000);
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &sigmask, &origmask);
    ready = poll(&fds, nfds, timeout);
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &origmask, NULL);
.fi
.PP
See the description of
.BR pselect (2)
for an explanation of why
.BR ppoll ()
is necessary.

If the
.I sigmask
argument is specified as NULL, then
no signal mask manipulation is performed
(and thus
.BR ppoll ()
differs from
.BR poll ()
only in the precision of the
.I timeout
argument).

The
.I timeout_ts
argument specifies an upper limit on the amount of time that
.BR ppoll ()
will block.
This argument is a pointer to a structure of the following form:
.in +4n
.nf

struct timespec {
    long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
};
.fi
.in

If
.I timeout_ts
is specified as NULL, then
.BR ppoll ()
can block indefinitely.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, a positive number is returned; this is
the number of structures which have nonzero
.I revents
fields (in other words, those descriptors with events or errors reported).
A value of 0 indicates that the call timed out and no file
descriptors were ready.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
The array given as argument was not contained in the calling program's
address space.
.TP
.B EINTR
A signal occurred before any requested event; see
.BR signal (7).
.TP
.B EINVAL
The
.I nfds
value exceeds the
.B RLIMIT_NOFILE
value.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
There was no space to allocate file descriptor tables.
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR poll ()
system call was introduced in Linux 2.1.23.
The
.BR poll ()
library call was introduced in libc 5.4.28
(and provides emulation using
.BR select (2)
if your kernel does not
have a
.BR poll ()
system call).

The
.BR ppoll ()
system call was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16.
The
.BR ppoll ()
library call was added in glibc 2.4.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.BR poll ()
conforms to POSIX.1-2001.
.BR ppoll ()
is Linux-specific.
.\" NetBSD 3.0 has a pollts() which is like Linux ppoll().
.SH NOTES
Some implementations define the nonstandard constant
.B INFTIM
with the value \-1 for use as a
.IR timeout
for
.BR poll ().
This constant is not provided in glibc.
.SS "Linux Notes"
The Linux
.BR ppoll ()
system call modifies its
.I timeout_ts
argument.
However, the glibc wrapper function hides this behavior
by using a local variable for the timeout argument that
is passed to the system call.
Thus, the glibc
.BR ppoll ()
function does not modify its
.I timeout_ts
argument.

BUGS section of
