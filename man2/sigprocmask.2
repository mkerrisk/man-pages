.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sigprocmask ()
is used to fetch and/or change the signal mask of the calling thread.
The signal mask is the set of signals whose delivery is currently
blocked for the caller
(see also
.BR signal (7)
for more details).

The behavior of the call is dependent on the value of
.IR how ,
as follows.
.TP
.B SIG_BLOCK
The set of blocked signals is the union of the current set and the
.I set
argument.
.TP
.B SIG_UNBLOCK
The signals in
.I set
are removed from the current set of blocked signals.
It is permissible to attempt to unblock a signal which is not blocked.
.TP
.B SIG_SETMASK
The set of blocked signals is set to the argument
.IR set .
.PP
If
.I oldset
is non-null, the previous value of the signal mask is stored in
.IR oldset .

If
.I set
is NULL, then the signal mask is unchanged (i.e.,
.I how
is ignored),
but the current value of the signal mask is nevertheless returned in
.I oldset
(it is not NULL).

The use of
.BR sigprocmask ()
is unspecified in a multithreaded process; see
.BR pthread_sigmask (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR sigprocmask ()
returns 0 on success and \-1 on error.
.SH ERRORS
.B EINVAL
The value specified in
.I how
was invalid.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
It is not possible to block
.BR SIGKILL " or " SIGSTOP .
Attempts to do so are silently ignored.

Each of the threads in a process has its own signal mask.

A child created via
.BR fork (2)
inherits a copy of its parent's signal mask;
the signal mask is preserved across
.BR execve (2).

If
.BR SIGBUS ,
.BR SIGFPE ,
.BR SIGILL ,
or
.B SIGSEGV
are generated
while they are blocked, the result is undefined,
unless the signal was generated by the
.BR kill (2),
.BR sigqueue (2),
or
.BR raise (3).
.PP
See
.BR sigsetops (3)
for details on manipulating signal sets.
