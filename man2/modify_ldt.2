.TH MODIFY_LDT 2 1995-07-22 "Linux 1.3.6" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
modify_ldt \- get or set ldt
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <linux/ldt.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "_syscall3(int, modify_ldt, int, " func ", void *, " ptr ", unsigned long, " bytecount )
.sp
.BI "int modify_ldt(int " "func" ", void *" "ptr" ", unsigned long " "bytecount" );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B modify_ldt
reads or writes the local descriptor table (ldt) for a process.
The ldt is a per-process memory management table used by the i386 processor.
For more information on this table, see an Intel 386 processor handbook.
.PP
When
.I func
is 0,
.B modify_ldt
reads the ldt into the memory pointed to by
.IR ptr .
The number of bytes read is the smaller of
.I bytecount
and the actual size of the ldt.
.PP
When
.I func
is 1,
.B modify_ldt
modifies one ldt entry.
.I ptr
points to a
.I modify_ldt_ldt_s
structure and
.I bytecount
must equal the size of this structure.
.\" .PP
.\" The ldt is specific for the calling process. Any attempts to change
.\" the ldt to include the address space of another process or the kernel
.\" will result in a segmentation violation when trying to access the memory
.\" outside of the process address space. The memory protection is enforced
.\" at the paging layer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.B modify_ldt
returns either the actual number of bytes read (for reading)
or 0 (for writing).
On failure,
.B modify_ldt
returns \-1 and sets
.IR errno .
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I ptr
points outside the address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I ptr
is 0,
or
.I func
is 1 and
.I bytecount
is not equal to the size of the structure
.IR modify_ldt_ldt_s ,
or
.I func
is 1 and the new ldt entry has invalid values.
.TP
.B ENOSYS
.I func
is neither 0 nor 1.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This call in Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended
to be portable.
