.TH ISWALNUM 3  1999-07-25 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswalnum \- test for alphanumeric wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswalnum(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswalnum ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR isalnum (3)
function.
It tests whether \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "alnum".
.PP
The wide-character class "alnum" is a subclass of the wide-character class
"graph", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character class "print".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print",
the wide-character class
"alnum" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph",
the wide-character class "alnum" is disjoint from
the wide-character class "space" and its subclass "blank".
.PP
The wide-character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-character class
"punct".
.PP
The wide-character class "alnum" is the union of the wide-character classes
"alpha" and "digit".
As such, it also contains the wide-character class
"xdigit".
.PP
The wide-character class "alnum" always contains at least the letters \(aqA\(aq
to \(aqZ\(aq, \(aqa\(aq to \(aqz\(aq and the digits \(aq0\(aq to \(aq9\(aq.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR iswalnum ()
function returns nonzero
if \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "alnum".
Otherwise it returns zero.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99.
.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR iswalnum ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
