.TH SETGID 2 2002-03-09 "Linux 2.5" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
setgid \- set group identity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int setgid(gid_t " gid );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B setgid
sets the effective group ID of the current process. If the caller is the
superuser, the real and saved group ID's are also set.

Under Linux, 
.B setgid
is implemented like the POSIX version with the _POSIX_SAVED_IDS feature.
This allows a setgid program that is not suid root to drop all of its group
privileges, do some un-privileged work, and then re-engage the original
effective group ID in a secure manner.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EPERM
The user is not the super-user (does not have the CAP_SETGID capability), and
.I gid
does not match the effective group ID or saved set-group-ID of
the calling process.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR getgid (2),
.BR setegid (2),
.BR setregid (2),
