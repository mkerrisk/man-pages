.SH NAME
modf, modff, modfl \- extract signed integral and fractional values from floating-point
number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double modf(double " x ", double *" iptr );
.sp
.BI "float modff(float " x ", float *" iptr );
.sp
.BI "long double modfl(long double " x ", long double *" iptr );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmodf()\fP function breaks the argument \fIx\fP into an integral
part and a fractional part, each of which has the same sign as \fIx\fP.
The integral part is stored in \fIiptr\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBmodf()\fP function returns the fractional part of \fIx\fP.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899.
The float and the long double variants are C99 requirements.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
