.SH NAME
expm1, expm1f, expm1l  \- exponential minus 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double expm1(double " x );
.sp
.BI "float expm1f(float " x );
.sp
.BI "long double expm1l(long double " x );
.sp
.fi
Link with \-lm.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI expm1( x )
returns a value equivalent to `exp (\fIx\fP) - 1'. It is
computed in a way that is accurate even if the value of \fIx\fP is near
zero--a case where `exp (\fIx\fP) - 1' would be inaccurate due to
subtraction of two numbers that are nearly equal.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
BSD, C99.
The float and the long double variants are C99 requirements.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR exp (3),
.BR log (3),
.BR log1p (3)
