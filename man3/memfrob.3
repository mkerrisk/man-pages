.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR memfrob ()
function encrypts the first \fIn\fP bytes of the

.BR memfrob ()
on the
encrypted memory area.

Note that this function is not a proper encryption routine as the XOR
constant is fixed, and is only suitable for hiding strings.

function returns a pointer to the encrypted memory
area.

The
.BR memfrob ()
function is unique to the
