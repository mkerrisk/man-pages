.SH NAME
fallocate \- manipulate file space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.B #include <fcntl.h>

.BI "int fallocate(int " fd ", int " mode ", off_t " offset \
", off_t " len ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a nonportable, Linux-specific system call.
For the portable, POSIX.1-specified method of ensuring that space
is allocated for a file, see
.BR posix_fallocate (3).

.BR fallocate ()
allows the caller to directly manipulate the allocated disk space
for the file referred to by
.I fd
for the byte range starting at
.I offset
and continuing for
.I len
bytes.

The
.I mode
argument determines the operation to be performed on the given range.
Details of the supported operations are given in the subsections below.
.SS Allocating disk space
The default operation (i.e.,
.I mode
is zero) of
.BR fallocate ()
allocates the disk space within the range specified by
.I offset
and
.IR len .
The file size (as reported by
.BR stat (2))
will be changed if
.IR offset + len
is greater than the file size.
Any subregion within the range specified by
.I offset
and
.IR len
that did not contain data before the call will be initialized to zero.
This default behavior closely resembles the behavior of the
.BR posix_fallocate (3)
library function,
and is intended as a method of optimally implementing that function.

After a successful call, subsequent writes into the range specified by
.IR offset
and
.IR len
are guaranteed not to fail because of lack of disk space.

If the
.B FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE
flag is specified in
.IR mode ,
the behavior of the call is similar,
but the file size will not be changed even if
.IR offset + len
is greater than the file size.
Preallocating zeroed blocks beyond the end of the file in this manner
is useful for optimizing append workloads.
.PP
Because allocation is done in block size chunks,
.BR fallocate ()
may allocate a larger range of disk space than was specified.
.SS Deallocating file space
Specifying the
.BR FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
flag (available since Linux 2.6.38) in
.I mode
deallocates space (i.e., creates a hole)
in the byte range starting at
.I offset
and continuing for
.I len
bytes.
Within the specified range, partial filesystem blocks are zeroed,
and whole filesystem blocks are removed from the file.
After a successful call,
subsequent reads from this range will return zeroes.

The
.BR FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
flag must be ORed with
.BR FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE
in
.IR mode ;
in other words, even when punching off the end of the file, the file size
(as reported by
.BR stat (2))
does not change.

Not all filesystems support
.BR FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE ;
if a filesystem doesn't support the operation, an error is returned.
The operation is supported on at least the following filesystems
.IP * 3
XFS (since Linux 2.6.38)
.IP *
ext4 (since Linux 3.0)

.SS Collapsing file space
.\" commit 00f5e61998dd17f5375d9dfc01331f104b83f841
Specifying the
.BR FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE
flag (available since Linux 3.15) in
.I mode
removes a byte range from a file, without leaving a hole.
The byte range to be collapsed starts at
.I offset
and continues for
.I len
bytes.
At the completion of the operation,
the contents of the file starting at the location
.I offset+len
will be appended at the location
.IR offset ,
and the file will be
.I len
bytes smaller.

A filesystem may place limitations on the granularity of the operation,
in order to ensure efficient implementation.
Typically,
.I offset
and
.I len
must be a multiple of the filesystem logical block size,
which varies according to the filesystem type and configuration.
If a filesystem has such a requirement,
.BR fallocate ()
will fail with the error
.BR EINVAL
if this requirement is violated.

If the region specified by
.I offset
plus
.I len
reaches or passes the end of file, an error is returned;
instead, use
.BR ftruncate (2)
to truncate a file.

No other flags may be specified in
.IR mode
in conjunction with
.BR FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE .

As at Linux 3.15,
.B FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE
is supported by
ext4 (only for extent-based files)

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR fallocate ()
returns zero.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
