New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

copy_file_range.2
    Anna Schumaker  [Darrick J. Wong, Christoph Hellwig, Michael Kerrisk]
        New page documenting copy_file_range()
            copy_file_range() is a new system call for copying ranges of data
            completely in the kernel.  This gives filesystems an opportunity to
            implement some kind of "copy acceleration", such as reflinks or
            server-side-copy (in the case of NFS).

personality.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        This page has been greatly expanded, to add descriptions of
        personality domains.

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Adhemerval Zanella]
        Significant reworking of this page:
        * Rework discussion of the (obsolete) binary mode
	* Split open_memstream(3) description into a separate page.
        * Note various fmemopen() bugs that were fixed in glibc 2.22
        * Greatly expand description of 'mode' argument
        * Rework description of 'buf' and 'len' arguments
        * Expand discussion of "current position" for fmemopen() stream

ntp_gettime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page describing ntp_gettime(3) and ntp_gettimex(3)

open_memstream.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page created by split of fmemopen(3).
        At the same time, add and rework a few details in the text.

posix_spawn.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister, Michael Kerrisk
        New man page documenting posix_spawn(3) and posix_spawnp(3)

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Split readdir_r() content into separate page
            As suggested by Florian Weimer:

                It may make sense to move this documentation to a separate
                manual page, specific to readdir_r.  This will keep the
                readdir() documentation nice and crisp.  Most programmers
                will never have to consult all these details.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Near complete restructuring of the page and add some further details
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer, Rich Felker, Paul Eggert]
        Add a lot more detail on portable use of the 'd_name' field

readdir_r.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        New page created after split of readdir(3).
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Explain why readdir_r() is deprecated and readdir() is preferred
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Remove misleading code example using pathconf()

lirc.4
    Alec Leamas
        New page documenting lirc device driver

adjtimex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document ntp_adjtime(3)

epoll_ctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jason Baron]
        Document EPOLLEXCLUSIVE

madvise.2
    Minchan Kim  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document MADV_FREE
            Document the MADV_FREE flag added to madvise() in Linux 4.5.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CmaTotal and CmaFree fields of /proc/meminfo
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document additional /proc/meminfo fields

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some kernel version numbers for /proc/PID/fdinfo entries
    Michael Kerrisk  [Patrick Donnelly]
        /proc/PID/fdinfo displays the setting of the close-on-exec flag
            Note also the pre-3.1 bug in the display of this info.

socket.7
    Craig Gallek  [Michael Kerrisk, Vincent Bernat]
        Document some BPF-related socket options

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update FTM requirements (_DEFAULT_SOURCE)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements
            Update to use _DEFAULT_SOURCE, and also changes brought by
            glibc commit 266865c0e7b79d4196e2cc393693463f03c90bd8.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify FTM requirements
            Looking at <features.h> (or feature_test_macros(7)), one can
            see that when _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with the value 700
            (or greater), then _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined with the value
            200809L (or greater). Therefore, terms in the man pages such as

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200809L

            can be simplified to:

                _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200809L

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify FTM requirements
            Looking at <features.h> (or feature_test_macros(7)), one can
            see that when _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with the value 600
            (or greater), then _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined with the value
            200112L (or greater). Therefore, terms in the man pages such as

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 600 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200112L

            can be simplified to:

                _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200112L

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify FTM requirements
            _XOPEN_SOURCE implies _POSIX_C_SOURCE >=2, so simplify FTM
            requirements in various pages.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "or 'cc -std=c99'" from SYNOPSIS
            Under the FTM requirements all of these pages document the
            requirement for _ISOC99_SOURCE. And feature_test_macros(7) now
            documents that "cc -std=c99" produces the same effect as defining
            _ISOC99_SOURCE. So, all of these pages don't additionally need
            to specify "or 'cc -std=c99'" under the FTM requirements
            in the SYNOPSIS. Removing that redundant text also simplifies
            the SYNOPSIS a little.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify FTM requirements
            Looking at <features.h> (or feature_test_macros(7)), one can
            see that when _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with the value 600
            (or greater), then _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined with the value
            200112L (or greater). Therefore, terms in the man pages such as

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 600 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200112L

            can be simplified to:

                _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200112L

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove references to _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED in SYNOPSIS
            _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is obsolete (it existed in SUSv1, but not
            subsequent standards). _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 produces the same
            effects as (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED). Modifying
            the SYNOPSIS of various ages that contain:

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 500 ||
                    _XOPEN_SOURCE\ &&\ _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

            to just:

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 500

            This has the following benefits:

            a) Simplifying the SYNOPSIS by removing ancient
               historical information.

            b) Preventing users from being misled into using
               _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED in new source code.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of the obsolete _POSIX_SOURCE macro from SYNOPSIS
            _POSIX_SOURCE was a POSIX.1-1990 creation that was soon made
            obsolete bu _POSIX_C_SOURCE. Retaining mention of it
            in the feature test macro requirements section of the
            SYNOPSIS doesn't contain important information, and may
            mislead readers into actually trying to use this macro.
            A few mentions of it are maintained in a some pages where
            defining _POSIX_SOURCE inhibits some behavior.

Various sockets-related pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Carlos O'Donell]
        Use consistent argument/variable names for socket addresses and lengths
            As noted by Carlos, there's quite a bit of inconsistency across
            pages. Use 'addr' and 'addrlen' consistently in variables and
            function arguments.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording fix: "current file offset" ==> "file offset"
            "File offset" is the preferred POSIX terminology.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Word "descriptor" more precisely
            Use either "file descriptor" or message queue descriptor".

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add reference to signal(7) in description of EINTR


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

locale.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Add "locale -c charmap" as an example
            Addresses https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104511.

localedef.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Add hint on purpose of --no-archive
            Indicate why using --no-archive might be a good idea. The issue
            is that if you create a custom locale with localedef(1) and put
            it to the locale archive then during the next glibc upgrade the
            locale archive is updated as well and your custom locale is gone.)

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: improve description for EBADF

adjtimex.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [John Stultz]
        Various improvements after feedback from John Stultz
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove FTM requirements
            It seems that adjtimex() never needed _BSD_SOURCE (and my
            earlier commit 5918743bc8b02b was simply a blunder).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split EINVAL error cases
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note treatment of out-of-range buf.offset
    Michael Kerrisk
        Don't refer reader to adjtime(3)
            Probably, it's not wise to suggest adjtime(3) as the more
            portable API. Rather, ntp_adjtime(3) should be used.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Naresh Kamboju]
        Update details of buf.offset EINVAL error
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ntp_gettime(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description of some PPS timex fields
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add ATTRIBUTES section
    William Preston  [Petr Gajdos]
        Update a detail in adjtimex return value description
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note range constraints and clamping for ADJ_FREQUENCY

bdflush.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc support for this system call went away in version 2.23

bind.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description of ENOENT error

bpf.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document close-on-exec semantics
            The close-on-exec file descriptor flag is automatically enabled
            for FDs returned by bpf().

chmod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify terminology (file mode versus file permission bits)

chown.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: improve EBADF description

clone.2
unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE
            The right way to expose declarations for these Linux-specific
            system calls was always _GNU_SOURCE. Mentioning the historical
            use of _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE just clouds the issue.

connect.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: improve EBADF description

create_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc 2.23 removed last vestiges of support for this system call

delete_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc 2.23 removed last vestiges of support for this system call

epoll_ctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document ELOOP error for circular monitoring loops

eventfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that eventfd info is available in /proc/PID/fdinfo

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Krzysztof Adamski]
        Add EPERM error for capabilities check of capability-dumb binaries
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to ld-linux.so(8)
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add system(3)

fanotify_init.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note kernel version that allowed O_CLOEXEC for event_f_flags

fcntl.2
flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add lslocks(8)

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jason Vas Dias]
        Rework description of F_SETOWN
            As suggested by Jason, make it clearer that I/O signalling
            requires the use of both F_SETOWN and O_ASYNC. While we're at,
            make a few other cleanups to the text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of _BSD_SOURCE to get definition of F_SETOWN/F_GETOWN
            This usage went away in glibc 2.20, and the simplest remedy
            is just to omit mention of it.

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME can now be used with FUTEX_WAIT

get_kernel_syms.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc des not support this system call

init_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc 2.23 removed last vestiges of support for this system call

ioctl_list.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Include uapi/linux/wireless.h
            Add the list of wireless IOCTLs.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Path to sockios.h
            sockios.h is now in include/uapi
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Add reference to netdevice.7
            netdevice.7 describes most of the IOCTLs of sockios.h
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Transfer structure (wireless.h IOCTLs)
            The sole parameter to be passed to the wireless.h IOCTLs is
            of type struct iwreq *.

ioperm.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alex Henrie]
        ioperm.2: Permissions are inherited across fork(2)
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99911

iopl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alex Henrie]
        Permissions are not inherited across fork(2) or preserved on execve(2)
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99901

lseek.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        FUSE now supports SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA
    Michael Kerrisk
	NFS supports SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA

    Michael Kerrisk

        NOTES: mention existence of proc/PID/fd and /proc/PID/fdinfo
    Mark Post  [Petr Gajdos]
        O_TMPFILE support is now provided bt Btrfs

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        Note treatment of 'pipefd' on error

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josh Triplett]
        Document spurious EAGAIN error that can occur on other systems
            Light reworking of text proposed by Josh Triplett.

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify EINVAL error description

    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Equivalence to read()
            Describe the recv(2)-read(2) and the recvfrom(2)-recv(2)
            equivalences for zero-valued arguments.
    Michael Kerrisk
        MSG_WAITALL has no effect for datagram sockets

recv.2
cmsg.3
    Nikola Forró
        Fix type of cmsg_len member of cmsghdr structure
            The type shown for cmsg_len member of cmsghdr structure is socklen_t,
            but the actual type used by glibc and the kernel is size_t.
            The information was obtained from glibc source code:
            http://bit.ly/21m1RMp
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that cmsg_len is typed as socklen_t in POSIX.1


sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer, Florian Weimer]
        Warn that CPU_ALLOC() may allocate a slightly CPU set than requested
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Add reference to CPU_ALLOC(3)

sched_setattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Akihiro Suda]
        EPERM depends on affinity mask of target thread, not calling thread

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josh Triplett]
        Document spurious EAGAIN error that can occur on other systems
            Light reworking of text proposed by Josh Triplett.
    Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos
        Mention the 'fd_set' size limitation early and refer to poll(2)
            Change this because of the serious limitation of select()
            imposing a limit on the range of file descriptors that can
            be monitored. This is currently mentioned too late in the
            documentation (in the NOTES section). The man page should
            warn early and refer to poll(2) as soon as possible.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add details on the glibc fixed-size fd_set limitation
            No modern application should use select() on Linux.

semctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Davidlohr Bueso, Manfred Spraul, Philip Semanchuk]
        NOTES: note when 'sempid' is set on various implementations
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112271 and
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2162754/

    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that signalfd info is available in /proc/PID/fdinfo

sigprocmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Explicitly refer the reader to sigsetops(3)
            This man page did not make it obvious which functions
            should be used for manipulating signals sets, nor where
            those functions were documented.

socketpair.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        Note treatment of 'sv' on error

splice.2

        Clarify description and document the Linux data integrity guarantees

syscall.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Add more architectures and improve error documentation
            Move the error register documentation into the main table rather
            than listing them in sentences after the fact.

            Add sparc error return details.

            Add details for alpha/arc/m68k/microblaze/nios2/powerpc/superh/
            tile/xtensa.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add copy_file_range(2)

times.2
    Kondo, Naoya
        Fix an incorrect description in NOTES
            The text has an incorrect description in NOTES, it says
            that (2^32/HZ) - 300 is about 429 million. It is correct
            only if HZ=10 which does not look common today. So just
            removing "(i.e., about 429 million)" is good enough.

truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add truncate(1)

uselib.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention CONFIG_USELIB
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc does not support this (obsolete) system call

wait.2
wait4.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename the "status" argument to "wstatus"
            The fact that exit(3)/_exit(2) has an argument called
            "status" and the same name is used in the arguments to the
            wait*() calls can a little too easily lead the user into
            thinking that the two arguments hold the same information,
            when of course they don't. So, use a different name
            for the argument of the wait*() functions, to reduce
            the chances of such confusion.

        gamma() was documented in SVID 2

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Schwab, Orion Poplawski]
        Update FTM requirements for glibc 2.22
            Since glibc 2.22 getaddrinfo() etc. are only declared for
            POSIX.1-2001 or later.

posix_fallocate.3
    Jérémie Galarneau
        ERRORS: add EINTR
            The glibc implementation of posix_fallocate(), which calls
            fallocate(), may be interrupted. The fallocate() emulation
            also makes use of pread()/pwrite(), which may also be
            interrupted.

rcmd.3

        Add missing condition concerning .rhosts file
            The list of conditions determining if iruserok() and ruserok()
            functions automatically fail is incomplete. According to glibc
            source code, the functions also fail if the .rhosts file
            is hard linked anywhere.

setbuf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add stdbuf(1)

setjmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite and merge longjmp()/siglongjmp() discussion into this page
            The discussion of nonlocal gotos is much easier to read if
            setjmp() and longjmp() are discussed in the same page. While
            we're at it, rework almost the entire text and add several
            more details.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the interactions of longjmp() and non-async-signal-safe functions
            POSIX.1-2008 TC2 adds explicit text on this point.

timegm.3

        Remove sample implementation of timegm()
            Stephen and Mats both question the wisdom of showing a portable
            *non-thread-safe* implementation of timegm(), and I find it
            hard to disagree. So, remove this code.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that man pages don't mention _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
            As per previous commit, mention of _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
