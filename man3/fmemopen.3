.TH FMEMOPEN 3 2005-12-08 "GNU" "glibc function"
.SH NAME
fmemopen, open_memstream \-  open memory as stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #define _GNU_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "FILE *fmemopen (void *"buf ", size_t "size ","
.BI "const char *" mode ");"
.sp
.BI "FILE * open_memstream(char ** "ptr ", size_t *" sizeloc )
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fmemopen ()
function opens a stream that permits the access specified by
.IR mode .
This stream allows I/O to be performed on a string or memory buffer, 
specified in
.IR buf .  
This buffer must be at least
.I size
bytes long.
.PP
If 
.I buf 
is specified as NULL, then
.BR  fmemopen ()
dynamically allocates an array
.I size
bytes long. 
This is only useful if
you are going to write things to the buffer and then read them back
in again, because there is no way of actually getting a pointer to
the buffer (but see the description of 
.BR open_memstream ()
below).
The buffer is automatically freed when the stream is closed.
.PP
The argument
.I mode
is the same as for
.BR fopen () .
If
.I mode
specifies an append mode, then
the initial file position is set to the first null character ('\\0');
otherwise the initial file position is set to the beginning of the buffer.
.PP
When a stream that has been opened for writing is flushed or closed, a null
character ('\\0') is written at the end of the buffer if there is space.
You should add an extra byte to the
.I size
argument to account for this.  
Attempts to write more than
.I size
bytes to the buffer result in an error.
.\" FIXME They should give an error, but see 
.\" http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1995
.PP
For a stream open for reading, null characters ('\\0') in the
buffer do not count as "end of file".  
Read operations indicate
end of file only when the file position advances past
.I size
bytes.
If you want to read characters from a NUL-terminated string,
you should supply the length of the string as the
.I size
argument.

The
.BR open_memstream ()
opens a stream for writing to a buffer.  
The buffer
is allocated dynamically (as with 
.BR malloc (3)),
and grown as necessary.
.\" FIXME The glibc doc doesn't say that the buffer must be freed,
.\" http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1997
After closing the stream, the caller should
.BR free (3)
this buffer

When the stream is closed with 
.BR fclose (3) 
or flushed with 
.BR fflush (3)
the locations 
.I ptr 
and 
.I sizeloc
are updated to contain the pointer to the buffer and its size.  
The values thus stored remain valid
only as long as no further output on the stream takes place.  
If you do more output, you must flush the stream again before
trying to access these variables again.

A null character ('\\0') is written at the end of the buffer.  
This character is 
.I not 
included in the size value stored at 
.IR sizeloc .
.\" 
.\" FIXME the following is from the glibc info doc, but appears not
.\" to be true: http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1996
.\" The stream's file position can be changed with with 
.\" .BR fseek (3) 
.\" or 
.\" .BR fseeko (3).
.\" Moving the file position past the end
.\" of the data already written fills the intervening space with
.\" zeroes.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion  
.BR fmemopen () 
and
.BR open_memstream ()
return a
.B FILE 
pointer.  
Otherwise, NULL is  returned  and  the  global  variable
.I errno 
is set to indicate the error.

.SH "EXAMPLE"
The program below uses 
.BR fmemopen ()
to open an input buffer, and
.BR open_memstream ()
to open a dynamically sized output buffer.
The program scans its input string (taken from the program's
first command-line argument) reading integers,
and writes the squares of these integers to the output buffer.
An example of the output produded by this program is the following:
.nf

$ ./a.out "1 23 43"
size=11; ptr=1 529 1849

#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    FILE *out, *in;
    int v, s;
    size_t size;
    char *ptr;

    assert(argc == 2);

    in = fmemopen(argv[1], strlen(argv[1]), "r");
    if (in == NULL) { perror("fmemopen"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE);}

    out = open_memstream(&ptr, &size);
    if (out == NULL) { perror("fmemopen"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE);}

    for (;;) {
        s = fscanf(in, "%d", &v);
        if (s <= 0)
            break;

        s = fprintf(out, "%d ", v * v);
        if (s == -1) { perror("fprintf"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }
    }
    fclose(in);
    fclose(out);
    printf("size=%ld; ptr=%s\\n", (long) size, ptr);
    free(ptr);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
