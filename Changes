New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

close_range.2
    Stephen Kitt, Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner]
        New page documenting close_range(2)

process_madvise.2
    Suren Baghdasaryan, Minchan Kim  [Michal Hocko, Alejandro Colomar,
    Michael Kerrisk]
        Document process_madvise(2)

fileno.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split fileno(3) content out of ferror(3) into new page
            fileno(3) differs from the other functions in various ways.
            For example, it is governed by different standards,
            and can set 'errno'. Conversely, the other functions
            are about examining the status of a stream, while
            fileno(3) simply obtains the underlying file descriptor.
            Furthermore, splitting this function out allows
            for some cleaner upcoming changes in ferror(3).


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Use 'restrict' in prototypes
            This change has been completed for *all* relevant pages
	    (around 135 pages in total).

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar  [Zack Weinberg]
        Remove unused <sys/types.h>
            The manual pages are already inconsistent in which headers need
            to be included.  Right now, not all of the types used by a
            function have their required header included in the SYNOPSIS.

            If we were to add the headers required by all of the types used by
            functions, the SYNOPSIS would grow too much.  Not only it would
            grow too much, but the information there would be less precise.

            Having system_data_types(7) document each type with all the
            information about required includes is much more precise, and the
            info is centralized so that it's much easier to maintain.

            So let's document only the include required for the function
            prototype, and also the ones required for the macros needed to
            call the function.

            <sys/types.h> only defines types, not functions or constants, so
            it doesn't belong to man[23] (function) pages at all.

            I ignore if some old systems had headers that required you to
            include <sys/types.h> *before* them (incomplete headers), but if
            so, those implementations would be broken, and those headers
            should probably provide some kind of warning.  I hope this is not
            the case.

            [mtk: Already in 2001, POSIX.1 removed the requirement to
            include <sys/types.h> for many APIs, so this patch seems
            well past due.]

A few pages
    Alejandro Colomar
        Add notes about missing glibc wrappers

_exit.2
abort.3
err.3
exit.3
pthread_exit.3
setjmp.3
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Use 'noreturn' in prototypes
            Use standard C11 'noreturn' in these manual page for
            functions that do not return.

Various pages
    Ganimedes Colomar  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Normalize SYNOPSIS notes about nonexistent glibc wrappers
            To easily distinguish documentation about glibc wrappers from
            documentation about kernel syscalls, let's have a normalized
            'Note' in the SYNOPSIS, and a further explanation in the page body
            (NOTES in most of them), as already happened in many (but not all)
            of the manual pages for syscalls without a wrapper.  Furthermore,
            let's normalize the messages, following membarrier.2 (because it's
            already quite extended), so that it's easy to use grep to find
            those pages.
        Normalize NOTES about nonexistent glibc wrappers
            This commit normalizes texts under sections other than SYNOPSIS
            (most of them in NOTES).


Global changes (formatting fixes and minor edits)
-------------------------------------------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: remove redundant statement that 'errno' is set
            This is implied in every other manual page. There is no need to
            state it explicitly in these pages.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use periods more consistently inside code comments
            In general, complete sentences in free-standing comments
            should be terminated by periods.

A few pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Better table formatting
            In particular, allow for rendering in widths different from
            (especially less than) 80 columns.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistency fix-up in FTMs
            Generally, place '||' at start of a line, rather than the end of
            the previous line.

            Rationale: this placement clearly indicates that that each piece
            is an alternative.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Bring more whitespace consistency in SYNOPSIS
            The use of vertical white space in the SYNOPSIS sections
            is rather inconsistent. Make it more consistent, subject to the
            following heuristics:

            * Prefer no blank lines between function signatures by default.
            * Where many functions are defined in the SYNOPSIS, add blank
              lines where needed to improve readability, possibly by using
              blank lines to separate logical groups of functions.

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
       Consistently use 'unsigned int'
            Most pages use 'unsigned int' (and the kernel too).
            Make them all do so.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various improvements in wording in RETURN VALUE

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/Glibc versions </Glibc </ in Feature Test Macro discussions
            Use a more compact notation that will render less wide
            on the terminal.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Standardize wording around setting of 'errno' on error
            In the RETURN VALUE sections, a number of different wordings
            are used in to describe the fact that 'errno' is set on error.
            There's no reason for the difference in wordings, since the same
            thing is being described in each case. Switch to a standard
            wording that is the same as FreeBSD and similar to the wording
            used in POSIX.1.

            In this change, "to indicate the cause of the error"
            is changed to "to indicate the error".

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add missing .nf/.fi in FTM info

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify mark-up for Feature Test Macro requirements
            Different source styles are used in different pages to achieve the
            same formatted output, and in some cases the source mark-up is a
            rather convoluted combination of .RS/.RE/.TP/.PD macros. Simplify
            this greatly, and unify all of the pages to use more or less the
            same source code style. This makes the source code rather easier
            to read, and may simplify future scripted global changes.

            The feature test macro info is currently bracketed by .nf/.fi
            pairs. This is not strictly necessary (i.e., it makes no
            difference to the rendered output), but for the moment we keep
            these "brackets" in case they may be replaced with something else.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use real minus signs in pathnames

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Standardize wording around setting of 'errno' on error
            In the RETURN VALUE sections, a number of different wordings
            are used in to describe the fact that 'errno' is set on error.
            There's no reason for the difference in wordings, since the same
            thing is being described in each case. Switch to a standard
            wording that is the same as FreeBSD and similar to the wording
            used in POSIX.1.

            In this change, reword various cases saying that 'errno' is set
            "appropriately" to "is set to indicate the error".

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve formatting in ATTRIBUTES
            Make the formatting more consistent inside the tables in the
            ATTRIBUTES sections. Make the source code more uniform; in
            particular, eliminate the use of custom tweaks using
            'lbwNN'/'lwNN' and .br macros.  In addition, ensure that
            hyphenation and text justification do not occur inside the tables.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
      Use .nf/.fi in SYNOPSIS
            The majority of pages use .nf/.fi in SYNOPSIS, but there are
            still many that don't and use .br to achieve newlines. Fix many
            of those. This brings greater consistency to the pages, which
            eases editing and may ease future scripted edits to the pages.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Standardize wording around setting of 'errno' on error
            In the RETURN VALUE sections, a number of different wordings
            are used in to describe the fact that 'errno' is set on error.
            There's no reason for the difference in wordings, since the same
            thing is being described in each case. Switch to a standard
            wording that is the same as FreeBSD and similar to the wording
            used in POSIX.1.

            In this change, miscellaneous descriptions of the setting
            of 'errno' are reworded to the norm of "is set to indicate
            the error".

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use "\-" to generate real minus in circumstances where appropriate
            Use \- for math formulas, pathnames, manual page cross references,
            etc.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Inside code blocks (.EX/.EE) use \- to get real minus signs
            A real minus can be cut and pasted...

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
        Remove explicit blank lines, replacing them with .PP when appropriate

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use internally consistent continuation indents in SYNOPSIS
            In the SYNOPSIS, a long function prototype may need to be
            continued over to the next line. The continuation line is
            indented according to the following rules:

            1. If there is a single such prototype that needs to be continued,
               then align the continuation line so that when the page is
               rendered on a fixed-width font device (e.g., on an xterm) the
               continuation line starts just below the start of the argument
               list in the line above.  (Exception: the indentation may be
               adjusted if necessary to prevent a very long continuation line
               or a further continuation line where the function prototype is
               very long.)

               Thus:

                   int tcsetattr(int fd, int optional_actions,
                                 const struct termios *termios_p);

            2. But, where multiple functions in the SYNOPSIS require
               continuation lines, and the function names have different
               lengths, then align all continuation lines to start in the
               same column.  This provides a nicer rendering in PDF output
               (because the SYNOPSIS uses a variable width font where
               spaces render narrower than most characters).

               Thus:

                   int getopt(int argc, char * const argv[],
                              const char *optstring);
                   int getopt_long(int argc, char * const argv[],
                              const char *optstring,
                              const struct option *longopts, int *longindex);

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Standardize wording around setting of 'errno' on error
            In the RETURN VALUE sections, a number of different wordings
            are used in to describe the fact that 'errno' is set on error.
            There's no reason for the difference in wordings, since the same
            thing is being described in each case. Switch to a standard
            wording that is the same as FreeBSD and similar to the wording
            used in POSIX.1.

            In this change, fix some instances stating that 'errno' is set
            "appropriately" to instead say "to indicate the error".

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

alloc_hugepages.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: reword to reflect that these system calls are long gone

cacheflush.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Update SYNOPSIS for glibc wrapper
            Glibc uses 'void *' instead of 'char *'.
            And the prototype is declared in <sys/cachectl.h>.

clone.2
    Valentin Kettner
        Fix types in clone_args
            A file descriptor is an int so it should be stored through an int
            pointer while parent_tid should have the same type as child_tid
            which is pid_t pointer.

close.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add close_range(2)

copy_file_range.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Document glibc wrapper instead of kernel syscall
            Glibc uses 'off64_t' instead of 'loff_t'.

delete_module.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Fix prototype parameter types
            The Linux kernel uses 'unsigned int' instead of 'int' for the
            'flags' parameter.  As glibc provides no wrapper, use the same
            type the kernel uses.

epoll_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: mention that epoll_create1() is Linux-specific

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: mention that epoll_pwait() is Linux-specific

execve.2
    Palmer Dabbelt
        Correct the versions of Linux that don't have ARG_MAX argv/envp size

execveat.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Fix prototype
            It's been 6 years since execveat(2) was added to the kernel,
            and there's still no glibc wrapper.  Let's document the kernel
            syscall prototype.

getcpu.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Rewrite page to describe glibc wrapper function
            Since glibc 2.29, there is a wrapper for getcpu(2).
            The wrapper has only 2 arguments, omitting the unused
            third system call argument. Rework the manual page
            to reflect this.

getgid.2
getuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that these interfaces never modify 'errno'
            See https://www.austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=511
            and the POSIX.1-2008 specifications of the interfaces.

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update FTM requirements for gethostname()

getpagesize.2
getdtablesize.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update/correct FTM requirements

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Starting in 2.33, glibc no longer provides vtimes()

ioctl_tty.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat argument type information
            The current mark-up renders poorly. To resolve this, move
            the type information into a separate line.

ipc.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Fix prototype parameter types

kcmp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 5.12, kcmp() availability is unconditional
            kcmp() is no longer dependent on CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE.

keyctl.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Fix prototype parameter types
            The Linux kernel uses 'unsigned long'.
            There's no reason to use the typedef '__kernel_ulong_t'.

lookup_dcookie.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Use standard types: u64 -> uint64_t

madvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add process_madvise(2)

mlock.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        mlock2(): Fix prototype parameter types
            The documented prototype for mlock2() was a mix of the
            glibc wrapper prototype and the kernel syscall prototype.
            Let's document the glibc wrapper prototype, which is shown below.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: note more explicitly which APIs are in the standards

mmap2.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Fix prototype parameter types
            There are many slightly different prototypes for this syscall,
            but none of them is like the documented one.
            Of all the different prototypes,
            let's document the asm-generic one.

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that the 'data' argument can be NULL

move_pages.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Add notes about missing glibc wrappers

open.2
rename.2
    Alyssa Ross
        Refer to tmpfs rather than shmem
            If I'm understanding correctly, tmpfs is a filesystem built on
            shmem, so I think it's more correct (and probably much more
            widely understandable) to refer to tmpfs here.

pciconfig_read.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Fix prototype parameter types
            Use the glibc prototypes instead of the kernel ones.
            Exception: use 'int' instead of 'enum'.

pidfd_open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the process_madvise(2) use case for PID file descriptors

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jonny Grant]
        Emphasize that the returned buffer is not null-terminated

s390_pci_mmio_write.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Add 'const' qualifier
            s390_pci_mmio_write() uses 'const void *' instead of 'void *'.

sched_setattr.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Add note about missing glibc wrappers

semctl.2
    Yang Xu  [Alejandro Colomar, Manfred Spraul]
        Correct SEM_STAT_ANY description

socketcall.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Add note about missing glibc wrapper

splice.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Use 'off64_t' instead of 'loff_t'
            The kernel syscall uses 'loff_t', but the glibc wrapper uses 'off64_t'.
            Let's document the wrapper prototype, as in other pages.

spu_create.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Fix prototype parameter type
            The 'flags' parameter of spu_create() uses 'unsigned int'.

    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Fix prototype parameter types
            The 2nd and 3rd parameters of spu_run() use 'uint32_t *'.

stat.2
    Jonathan Wakely  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Remove <unistd.h> from SYNOPSIS
            There seems to be no reason <unistd.h> is shown here, so remove it.

tkill.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Fix prototype parameter types
            All but the last parameters of t[g]kill() use 'pid_t',
            both in the kernel and glibc.

vmsplice.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Fix prototype parameter type
            The 3rd parameter of vmsplice() uses 'size_t' in glibc.

fread.3
    Alessandro Bono
        EXAMPLES: swap size and nmemb params
            It works both ways, but this one feels more right. We are reading
            four elements sizeof(*buffer) bytes each.

fseeko.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move info about obsolete FTM from SYNOPSIS to NOTES
            This makes the SYNOPSIS more consistent with other pages.

        Remove mention of _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED FTM
            This rather ancient FTM is not mentioned in other pages for
            reasons discussed in feature_test_macros(7).  Remove this FTM
            from the three pages where it does appear.

malloc.3
    Alejandro Colomar  [Johannes Pfister]
        Document that realloc(p, 0) is specific to glibc and nonportable

    Michael Kerrisk  [Bastien Roucariès]
        Note the default if PAGER is not defined
    Michael Kerrisk
        Be a little more precise when discussing 'exec'
            Say "execve(2)" instead of "exec(3)", and note that this step
            starts a new program (not a new process!).
    Michael Kerrisk  [Bastien Roucariès]

            greater consistency in the SYNOPIS, RETURN VALUE and ATTRIBUTES
            sections. To avoid future inconsistencies, try to capture some of
            the preferred conventions in text in man-pages(7).
