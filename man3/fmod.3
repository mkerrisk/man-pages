.SH NAME
fmod, fmodf, fmodl \- floating-point remainder function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <math.h>
.sp
.BI "double fmod(double " x ", double " y );
.sp
.BI "float fmodf(float " x ", float " y );
.sp
.BI "long double fmodl(long double " x ", long double " y );
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfmod()\fP function computes the remainder of dividing \fIx\fP by
\fIy\fP.  The return value is \fIx\fP - \fIn\fP * \fIy\fP, where \fIn\fP
is the quotient of \fIx\fP / \fIy\fP, rounded towards zero to an integer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBfmod()\fP function returns the remainder, unless \fIy\fP is zero,
when the function fails and \fIerrno\fP is set.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EDOM
The denominator \fIy\fP is zero.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899.
The float and the long double variants are C99 requirements.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR remainder (3)
