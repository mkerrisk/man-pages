function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR stpcpy (3)

including the terminating null wide character (L\(aq\\0\(aq),
to the array pointed to by
\fIdest\fP.
.PP
The strings may not overlap.

The programmer must ensure that there
is room for at least \fIwcslen(src)+1\fP
wide characters at \fIdest\fP.

returns a pointer to the end of the wide-character string
\fIdest\fP, that is, a pointer to the terminating null wide character.
