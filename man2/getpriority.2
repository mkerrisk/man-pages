.TH GETPRIORITY 2 2002-06-21 "BSD Man Page" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getpriority, setpriority \- get/set program scheduling priority
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/time.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/resource.h>
.sp
.BI "int getpriority(int " which ", int " who );
.br
.BI "int setpriority(int " which ", int " who ", int " prio );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The scheduling priority of the process, process group, or user, as
indicated by
.I which
and
.I who
is obtained with the
.B getpriority
call and set with the
.B setpriority
call.

The value
.I which
is one of
.BR PRIO_PROCESS ,
.BR PRIO_PGRP ,
or
.BR PRIO_USER ,
and 
.I who
is interpreted relative to 
.I which
(a process identifier for
.BR PRIO_PROCESS ,
process group
identifier for
.BR PRIO_PGRP ,
and a user ID for
.BR PRIO_USER ).
A zero value for
.I who
denotes (respectively) the calling process, the process group of the
calling process, or the real user ID of the calling process.
.I Prio
is a value in the range \-20 to 20 (but see the Notes below).
The default priority is 0;
lower priorities cause more favorable scheduling.

The
.B getpriority
call returns the highest priority (lowest numerical value)
enjoyed by any of the specified processes.  The
.B setpriority
call sets the priorities of all of the specified processes
to the specified value.  Only the super-user may lower priorities.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Since
.B getpriority
can legitimately return the value \-1, it is necessary
to clear the external variable
.I errno
prior to the
call, then check it afterwards to determine
if a \-1 is an error or a legitimate value.
The
.B setpriority
call returns 0 if there is no error, or
\-1 if there is.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I which
was not one of
.BR PRIO_PROCESS ,
.BR PRIO_PGRP ,
or
.BR PRIO_USER .
.TP
.B ESRCH
No process was located using the 
.I which
and
.I who
values specified.
.PP
In addition to the errors indicated above,
.B setpriority
may fail if:
.TP
.B EPERM
A process was located, but its effective user ID did not match
either the effective or the real user ID of the caller,
and (on Linux systems) the caller did not have the 
.B CAP_SYS_NICE
capability.
.TP
.B EACCES
A non super-user attempted to lower a process priority.
.SH NOTES
The details on the condition for EPERM depend on the system.
The above description is what SUSv3 says, and seems to be followed on
all SYSV-like systems.
Linux requires the real or effective user ID of the caller to match
the real user of the process \fIwho\fP (instead of its effective user ID).
All BSD-like systems (SunOS 4.1.3, Ultrix 4.2,
BSD 4.3, FreeBSD 4.3, OpenBSD-2.5, ...) require
the effective user ID of the caller to match
the real or effective user ID of the process \fIwho\fP.
.LP
The actual priority range varies between kernel versions.
Linux before 1.3.36 had -infinity..15. Linux since 1.3.43 has -20..19,
and the system call getpriority returns 40..1 for these values
(since negative numbers are error codes).
The library call converts N into 20-N.
.LP
Including
.I <sys/time.h>
is not required these days, but increases portability.
(Indeed,
.I <sys/resource.h>
defines the
.I rusage
structure with fields of type
.I struct timeval
defined in
.IR <sys/time.h> .)
