.TH ISWXDIGIT 3  1999-07-25 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswxdigit \- test for hexadecimal digit wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswxdigit(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswxdigit ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR isxdigit (3)
function.
It tests whether \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "xdigit".
.PP
The wide-character class "xdigit" is a subclass of the wide-character class
"alnum", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character class "graph" and
of the wide-character class "print".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-character class
"xdigit" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-character class
"xdigit" is disjoint from the wide-character class "space" and its subclass
"blank".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-character class
"xdigit" is disjoint from the wide-character class "punct".
.PP
The wide-character class "xdigit" always contains at least the
letters \(aqA\(aq to \(aqF\(aq, \(aqa\(aq to \(aqf\(aq
and the digits \(aq0\(aq to \(aq9\(aq.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR iswxdigit ()
function returns nonzero if \fIwc\fP is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "xdigit".
Otherwise it returns zero.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
C99.
.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR iswxdigit ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR iswctype (3),
.BR isxdigit (3)
