.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This utility shall be provided on systems that support both the User
Portability Utilities option and the Software Development
Utilities option. On other systems it is optional. Certain options
are only available on XSI-conformant systems.
.LP
The \fInm\fP utility shall display symbolic information appearing
in the object file, executable file, or object-file library
named by \fIfile\fP. If no symbolic information is available for a
valid input file, the \fInm\fP utility shall report that fact,
but not consider it an error condition.
.LP
The default base used when numeric values are written is unspecified.
\ On XSI-conformant systems, it shall be decimal. 
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fInm\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
The following options shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fB-A\fP
Write the full pathname or library name of an object on each line.
.TP 7
\fB-e\fP
Write only external (global) and static symbol information. 
.TP 7
\fB-f\fP
Produce full output. Write redundant symbols ( \fB.text\fP, \fB.data\fP,
and \fB.bss\fP), normally suppressed. 
.TP 7
\fB-g\fP
Write only external (global) symbol information.
.TP 7
\fB-o\fP
Write numeric values in octal (equivalent to \fB-t\ o\fP). 
.TP 7
\fB-P\fP
Write information in a portable output format, as specified in the
STDOUT section.
.TP 7
\fB-t\ \fP \fIformat\fP
Write each numeric value in the specified format. The format shall
be dependent on the single character used as the
\fIformat\fP option-argument: 
.TP 7

.RS
The offset is written in decimal   \ (default). 
.RE
.TP 7
\fBo\fP
.RS
The offset is written in octal.
.RE
.TP 7

.RS
The offset is written in hexadecimal.
.RE
.sp
.TP 7
\fB-u\fP
Write only undefined symbols.
.TP 7
\fB-v\fP
Sort output by value instead of alphabetically.
.TP 7
\fB-x\fP

.LP
The following operand shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fIfile\fP
A pathname of an object file, executable file, or object-file library.
.sp
.SH STDIN
.LP
See the INPUT FILES section.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
The input file shall be an object file, an object-file library whose
format is the same as those produced by the \fIar\fP utility for link
editing, or an executable file. The \fInm\fP utility may accept additional
implementation-defined object library formats for the input file.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fInm\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_COLLATE\fP
.sp
Determine the locale for character collation information for the symbol-name
and symbol-value collation sequences.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.

.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
Default.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Mechanisms for dynamic linking make this utility less meaningful when
applied to an executable file because a dynamically linked
executable may omit numerous library routines that would be found
in a statically linked executable.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Historical implementations of \fInm\fP have used different bases for
numeric output and supplied different default types of
symbols that were reported. The \fB-t\fP \fIformat\fP option, similar
to that used in \fIod\fP and \fIstrings\fP, can be used to specify
the numeric
base; \fB-g\fP and \fB-u\fP can be used to restrict the amount of
output or the types of symbols included in the output.
.LP
The compromise of using \fB-t\fP \fIformat\fP \fIversus\fP using \fB-d\fP,
\fB-o\fP, and other similar options was
necessary because of differences in the meaning of \fB-o\fP between
implementations. The \fB-o\fP option from BSD has been
provided here as \fB-A\fP to avoid confusion with the \fB-o\fP from
System V (which has been provided here as \fB-t\fP and as
\fB-o\fP on XSI-conformant systems).
.LP
The option list was significantly reduced from that provided by historical
implementations.
.LP
The \fInm\fP description is a subset of both the System V and BSD
\fInm\fP utilities with no specified default output.
.LP
It was recognized that mechanisms for dynamic linking make this utility
less meaningful when applied to an executable file
(because a dynamically linked executable file may omit numerous library
routines that would be found in a statically linked
executable file), but the value of \fInm\fP during software development
was judged to outweigh other limitations.
.LP
The default output format of \fInm\fP is not specified because of
differences in historical implementations. The \fB-P\fP
option was added to allow some type of portable output format. After
a comparison of the different formats used in SunOS, BSD,
SVR3, and SVR4, it was decided to create one that did not match the
current format of any of these four systems. The format devised
is easy to parse by humans, easy to parse in shell scripts, and does
not need to vary depending on locale (because no English
descriptions are included). All of the systems currently have the
information available to use this format.
.LP
The format given in \fInm\fP STDOUT uses spaces between the fields,
which may be any number of <blank>s required to align
the columns. The single-character types were selected to match historical
practice, and the requirement that implementation
additions also be single characters made parsing the information easier
for shell scripts.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
