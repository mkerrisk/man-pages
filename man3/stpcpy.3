.TH STPCPY 3  2009-02-04 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
stpcpy \- copy a string returning a pointer to its end
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #define _GNU_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "char *stpcpy(char *" dest ", const char *" src );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR stpcpy ()
function copies the string pointed to by \fIsrc\fP
(including the terminating \(aq\\0\(aq character) to the array pointed to by
\fIdest\fP.
The strings may not overlap, and the destination string
\fIdest\fP must be large enough to receive the copy.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR stpcpy ()
returns a pointer to the \fBend\fP of the string
\fIdest\fP (that is, the address of the terminating null byte)
rather than the beginning.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This function is not part of the C or POSIX.1 standards, and is
not customary on Unix systems, but is not a GNU invention either.
Perhaps it comes from MS-DOS.
Nowadays, it is also present on the BSDs.
.SH EXAMPLE
For example, this program uses
.BR stpcpy ()
to concatenate \fBfoo\fP and
\fBbar\fP to produce \fBfoobar\fP, which it then prints.
.in +4n
.nf

#include <string.h>

int
main(void)
{
    char *to = buffer;
    to = stpcpy(to, "foo");
    to = stpcpy(to, "bar");
    printf("%s\\n", buffer);
}
